# Isegoria — Formal Specification and Verification Audit

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | DRAFT — independent audit of commit `c4a09b1f778037c9d80dd7a85f3243311a1714ec` (2026-09-16). Not yet reviewed by the maintainers. |
| **Intended path** | `docs/08-formal-specification.md` |
| **Companion** | `docs/07-verification-and-assurance.md` (methodology), `docs/09-verification-matrix.md` (to be created from §15 of this document) |
| **Normative language** | MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / MAY as in RFC 2119. |
| **Evidence vocabulary** | HYPOTHESIS, IMPLEMENTED, TESTED, REPRODUCED, INDEPENDENTLY_REVIEWED, SCIENTIFICALLY_CHARACTERIZED, PRODUCTION_CANDIDATE, PRODUCTION_READY; plus **NOT ESTABLISHED** when no evidence exists. A status is never assigned above what the cited evidence supports. |

## 0. How this document was produced, and what it did not do

This specification was written by an independent auditor with read access to the full repository. Method:

1. Every file in the repository was read: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, all of `docs/`, all four crates (`crates/{scoring,identity,network,protocol}`), all tests, all fixtures, `sim/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. The Python simulations were **executed by the auditor** (numpy 2.4.4, scipy 1.17.1) and their output compared with the documented "expected results" and with the committed fixtures.
3. Small independent probes were run in Python to falsify specific claims (BRIDGE-005, COLLUSION-002, COLLUSION-004, NET-003, REPRO-003).
4. **The Rust test suite was NOT executed by the auditor** (no Rust toolchain was available in the audit environment). Every statement below about what the Rust tests assert is based on reading the test source, not on observing a green run. The repository's CI configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) claims `cargo test --workspace` on every push; that claim was not independently verified.
5. Dependency source was inspected where a correctness argument depended on library behaviour (`opentimestamps` 0.2.0 step-output computation, NET-008).

Nothing in this document infers correctness from the existing code or documentation. Where the documentation makes a claim, this document states what evidence exists for it, and the status assigned is the lowest status consistent with that evidence.

## 0-bis. Remediation log (maintainer, post-audit)

The audit body below is a **snapshot of commit `c4a09b1`** and is left unedited: its findings were real at that commit. This log records the maintainer fixes applied afterwards. It does not re-run the audit; a finding is marked RESOLVED only where the code-level defect is closed and a regression test pins it. Design-level and multi-part findings remain open beyond the specific sub-fix noted.

Fixes landed on branch `fix/audit-concrete-bugs`, commit `289aae3` — six concrete, design-free code defects. Workspace: 149 tests green; `cargo fmt` and `clippy -D warnings` clean.

| Finding | Was | Now | Fix | Regression test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COLLUSION-004 (§5.4) | INV-14 VIOLATED — sub-unit weights boosted (`0.25 → 0.5`) | **RESOLVED** | per-node multiplier `s^{α−1}` and `sublinear_group_weight` capped so the transform never increases a weight | `anti_collusion.rs::discount_never_increases_a_weight`, `::group_weight_is_capped_at_its_raw_total` (AT-COL-04) |
| NET-003 (§5.8, §10.2) | DEFECT — duplicate-last-node; `root([x,y,z]) == root([x,y,z,z])` | **RESOLVED** | RFC 6962 promotion of the odd node; `merkle_root`/`merkle_proof` share `next_level` | `integrity.rs::root_commits_to_the_leaf_count`, `::inclusion_proofs_verify_at_every_size` (AT-NET-02) |
| PROTO-011 / G-18 (§5.9) | DEFECT — `Draft::content_id` fields not length-prefixed | **RESOLVED** | each field length-prefixed before hashing | `lifecycle.rs::content_id_is_unambiguous_across_the_field_boundary` (AT-PRO-04) |
| REPUTATION-003 guard (§5.4) | `brier_skill_score` divides by zero on a zero-variance baseline | **RESOLVED (sub-fix)** — the guard only; the baseline choice (crowd vs base-rate) stays open (G-09) | `den == 0.0 → 0.0` (finite, neutral) | `level_c.rs::brier_skill_score_is_finite_when_the_baseline_is_perfect` (AT-REP-03) |
| DIF-003 guard (§6.5) | `mantel_haenszel` panics on NaN θ (`partial_cmp().unwrap()`) | **RESOLVED (sub-fix)** — the panic only; the stratification/significance gaps stay open | incomparable values treated as equal | `level_b.rs::mantel_haenszel_tolerates_a_nan_theta` |
| ID-003(ii) (§5.5) | `label_with_quorum` accepts duplicate indices → wrong label silently | **RESOLVED (sub-fix)** — duplicate-index guard only; DKG/transport/external review stay open | reject non-distinct quorum indices | `oprf.rs::a_quorum_with_duplicate_indices_is_refused` (AT-ID-04) |

Everything else in §14 (gaps), §16 (acceptance gate) and the rest of §15 is unchanged: the wiring gaps (BRIDGE-007, PROTO-007) and the design-open questions (§17) are untouched by these fixes.

## 0-ter. Post-remediation re-check (auditor, 2026-09-17)

Re-audit of `e43f1bf` against `c4a09b1`, by the same auditor. This time the Rust suite **was executed** (rustc 1.89.0 from the Ubuntu archive — the pinned 1.86.0 was not reachable; results are functional, not bit-level): at `e43f1bf`, 149 passed / 2 ignored; on this branch, 154 passed / 2 ignored, `cargo fmt --check` and `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean under clippy 1.89 (which adds one lint, `cloned_ref_to_slice_refs`, that 1.86 does not have; fixed in `lifecycle.rs:478`).

**The six fixes of §0-bis are confirmed**, with independent replication of the Merkle and discount corrections (promotion construction: proofs verify for n = 1…39 and `root(L) ≠ root(L ++ [last])`; `discount_weights([0.25]) = 0.25`, 400 clones → 20). Two caveats:

- **DIF-003 guard.** `partial_cmp().unwrap_or(Equal)` avoids the panic but is not a total order (NaN "equals" everything), and Rust ≥ 1.81 sorts are permitted to detect a non-total comparator and panic; the 6-element regression test cannot exercise that path. Replaced on this branch by `f64::total_cmp` (NaN sorts last, deterministically) at all five float-sort sites — `dif.rs`, `governance.rs`, `review.rs`, `reputation.rs::median`, `blueprint.rs` — closing IQ-2. Tests: `level_b.rs::mantel_haenszel_tolerates_nan_theta_at_sort_detection_sizes` (n = 200), `lifecycle.rs::float_sorts_tolerate_nan_positions_without_panicking`.
- **REPRO-003, now with the repository's own guard.** `cargo test -p scoring --test fixture_drift -- --ignored` **fails** in a numpy 2.4.4 / scipy 1.17.1 environment (`expected_levelA.csv` token 10: `0.107583` vs `0.107804`). Recorded in `crates/scoring/tests/fixtures/PROVENANCE.md`; roadmap T4 stands.

**New finding — PROTO-012 (`protocol::aggregate`, merged in `b139acf`, not covered by §0-bis).** `resolve_band(aggregate_pass_probability(p, w), 0.5)` is a weighted arithmetic mean of the *same* ratings the bridging model already consumed, compared to 0.5. That is the "simple average" `docs/01` D2 rejects, applied as the deciding rule for the one class of items (the band) where bridging is undecided; it carries no cross-axis requirement. Evidence, now pinned by `documents_limitation_*` tests: on the oracle fixtures the rule advances **every** item, including 08 and 09 that bridging rejects for polarization (unit-weight means 0.593 and 0.708); a 120-vs-80 polarized panel at 0.9/0.3 with no cartel resolves in favour (0.66); the "√k never flips" scenario holds only for exact-copy cartels with k < 576 (flip at k = 576), and a jittered cartel (σ ≈ 0.05) is not clustered at all (COLLUSION-002), flipping the same panel at k ≈ 65. On the fixtures all three band items (1, 5, 6) have mean ≥ 0.83, so "resolved by review" and "passed by default" are not distinguishable by the e2e test. The module also does **not** address BRIDGE-007: `bridging::fit` remains unweighted, so the discount changes this tie-break and nothing else. Finally, the mechanism contradicts `docs/01` D26 (decided the same day): "more reviewers, then a clean re-decision against the plain threshold". `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "the review aggregation is **done** and **wired into the epoch**" has been corrected on this branch to "provisional tie-break"; roadmap T5 and T10 correctly remain open, and T30 is added. Status: **IMPLEMENTED (tie-break); INV-2 substantively not provided for band items; D26 NOT IMPLEMENTED.**

**Decisions D17–D31 vs. code.** Consistent with §17 (Q-15, D15's "preferred" separation, remains undecided). Three are *decided but not implemented* and should be tracked as such: D20 (`pilot::stage2_dif` is still on the production e2e path with no calibration gate — T32), D23 (`base_rate_baseline` was the only baseline — now RESOLVED@T31 via `reputation::crowd_baseline`), D26 (above — T30).

**Matrix deltas (§15).** Added PROTO-012; IQ-2 closed; REPRO-003 now carries repository-native failing evidence; ID-003 unchanged beyond §0-bis; everything else as in §0-bis.

## 0-quater. Findings of the working paper (2026-09-24)

The working paper in `paper/` (v0.1 at `2ee5e79`; v0.2 adds the adopted revisions)
analysed the scoring mechanism with proofs and reproducible experiments
(`paper/scripts/`). Its findings are new claims for the matrix of §15; all are decided
(`docs/01` D32–D41) and planned (`docs/10` Phase 1.1). Each item below carries its
status; what the repository changed after the paper's snapshot is listed in
`paper/README.md`.

- **BRIDGE-008 — The gate is relative to its batch.** With `μ` unpenalized,
  `Σ_j b_j = 0` at every stationary point (paper Lemma 1), so `B_j ≥ τ > 0` cannot hold
  for a whole batch and the score of an item depends on the other items fitted with it:
  six consensus items of the fixture pass (5 of 6) with the divisive items present and
  all fail alone; ten weak decoys lift them from ≈ +0.09 to ≈ +0.32. Status:
  **RESOLVED** (D32, T49, 2026-09-24): the gate reads the side-balanced score, which
  stays within 0.02 alone, in the batch and next to ten decoys (`AT-BR-09`).
- **BRIDGE-009 — Camp-size neutrality holds only partly.** The origin of the axis is a
  gauge fixed by the penalties alone; in a two-camp model the intercept keeps a fraction
  `1/(1+ρ)`, `ρ ≈ (λ_b/λ_f)√(S/n)`, of the camp-size effect — 0.53–0.87 at the defaults
  for 50–3,200 reviewers, confirmed on the full model. Status: **RESOLVED** (D32, T49,
  2026-09-24): the side-balanced score leaks at most 0.1 from 200 reviewers (0.1–0.2
  residual at 50–100, a fraction of the intercept's), and appeal eligibility reads the
  side gap, not `|f_j|`, which falls as the camps become unequal (`AT-BR-08`).
- **DIF-010 — Error in the ability proxy creates latent classes.** Given the anchor total,
  trial items are positively dependent even without DIF (paper Prop 10); on null batches
  at N = 6,000 the production detector flags clean items with 10 or 20 anchors (KR-20
  0.69 / 0.82; spurious gaps of 1.04–1.16 across the paper's four seeds, one to three
  clean items flagged) and passes at 30 (0.87) by 0.01–0.06. The differential gap is no remedy on
  its own: with 6 of 8 items biased it inverts the verdict. Status: **PARTLY RESOLVED** —
  the precondition is enforced (T53, 2026-09-25): `pilot::admit_anchors` refuses the
  latent re-check when the anchors' KR-20 on the batch's respondents (`irt::kr20`) is
  below `KR20_MIN = 0.90`, `revalidate_batch_latent` takes the anchors and computes θ
  itself, and the differential gap is `MixtureDif::differential`, diagnostic only
  (`AT-DIF-11` ✓, `anchor_reliability.rs`; the inversion in a campaign,
  `latent_classes.rs`). **RESOLVED** with the target model (T54, 2026-09-25):
  `scoring::latent::latent_dif` — the anchors inside the likelihood, θ integrated out —
  is the production fit (`revalidate_batch_latent`); on the paper's null batches it
  selects 1 class at 10, 20, 30 and 60 anchors (KR-20 0.68–0.94), no item flagged, where the proxy model selects two classes at 10, 20 and 30 anchors and flags 8, 2 and 0 clean items (`latent_target_model.rs`); the campaigns are flagged on exactly
  the shifted items (`AT-DIF-12` ✓). Bears on DIF-006 and DIF-008.
- **DIF-011 — DIF is not bias.** When one class is misinformed about a true fact, an item
  stating it shows DIF by construction, and Level B rejected it for the reason Level A
  did (paper §4.7). Status: **RESOLVED** (D38, T55, 2026-09-25): a flagged item whose key
  the source check establishes (`docs/02` §B.5) is a *contested fact*
  (`lifecycle::State::Contested`), kept in `protocol::contested::ContestedPool` and
  drawn into a test only in selections whose DTF bound — the sum over fits of each fit's
  unsigned DTF (`scoring::dtf`) — is at most `DTF_MAX = 0.10` (`AT-PRO-08` ✓). Open: the
  bound's sampling error (a drawn pair with a fitted bound of 0.076 had a true DTF of
  0.104 at N = 3,000) and the tolerance are T24/T25; the source check runs outside the
  code until T68.
- **REPUTATION-008 — The evaluator score is not proper.** The ratio-form BSS rewards
  moving toward the crowd: with one scored item `logit p* = logit q + 2 logit b` (paper
  Prop 12). Scoring only items that pass the gate would also be improper. Status:
  **RESOLVED** — the score is the leave-one-out difference score, strictly proper
  (D33, T50, 2026-09-25: `reputation::loo_scores`, `AT-REP-05` ✓, and the paper's
  dissenter example reproduced on the retired function, `evaluator_score.rs`), and since
  T52 (D35, 2026-09-25) the scored items are the live outcomes too: a random 5% of gate
  rejections, drawn from the beacon, is piloted for measurement only and every observed
  score enters the mean at `1/π_j` (`protocol::exploration`,
  `probation::SkillTrack::record_observed`, `reputation::inverse_probability_mean`;
  `AT-REP-06` ✓ exact and by Monte Carlo, `AT-PRO-07` ✓).
- **REPUTATION-004 (update).** The asymmetric update penalizes variance: an honest
  reviewer better than the crowd (true +0.009) is held at −0.061, while a crowd copier
  stays at 0. Status: **RESOLVED** (D34, T51, 2026-09-25): the weight reads the
  symmetric mean of the per-item scores and a one-sided CUSUM against it
  (`reputation::Cusum`, `probation::SkillTrack`) sends a reviewer whose scores drop back
  to probation; `asymmetric_ema` removed; `AT-REP-07` ✓ (`change_detector.rs`). The
  game-theoretic `AT-REP-01` stays open.
- **REPUTATION-005 (update).** Rescaling to `E_u / median(E)` does not give the cap force;
  only an unbounded scale does. **RESOLVED** (D33, T50): the weight is
  `exp(γ·S_u·k_u/(k_u+k₀))`, unbounded, and `3 × median` binds on an outlier (`AT-REP-04` ✓).
- **COLLUSION-006 — There is almost nothing to correlate within an epoch.** Two reviewers
  share `r²/m` items per epoch on average (0.81 at `r = 9`, `m = 100`); raw correlations
  also cannot separate a cartel (+0.93) from honest same-camp pairs (+0.94), whereas
  residual correlations can (+0.88 vs +0.02). Status: **RESOLVED** — the residual
  detector over long histories is implemented (D39, T56, 2026-09-25:
  `collusion::{ResidualHistory, coordination_clusters}`; on the paper's dataset every
  cartel pair and no honest pair is flagged, `AT-COL-07` ✓, `AT-COL-02` ✓), and a
  detected cluster constrains the assignment (D40, T57: `review::assign_diverse`, at most
  one member per panel, the extra round included, no weight touched; `AT-BR-10` ✓).
- **CRYPTO-008 (update).** The beacon is decided: commit-reveal now, a threshold signature
  after T19 (D41, T37). **RESOLVED** (T37, 2026-09-26): every draw seeds from the epoch's
  commit-reveal beacon (`network::beacon`, `randomness::Beacon::from_outcome`, §9.4), which
  nothing on the log after the commit set moves, and the lottery reads the set of deposits
  in content-id order, not the log's (AT-BR-05, AT-NET-10).

## 0-quinquies. Findings of the third review (2026-09-24)

An independent review of master at `30fb02e` (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, the workspace
tests with and without `calibration`, and `fixture_drift` under the pinned environment
all green) wrote one probe test per suspected weakness. Each probe asserts the *current*
behaviour, so a probe that passes confirms the weakness; all thirteen pass on `30fb02e`
(re-run 2026-09-24). Each is planned in `docs/10`, and each fix starts from its probe
with the assertion inverted; a finding is marked RESOLVED below once its fix and its
regression test are on master.

- **PROTO-007 (update) — a deposit can be replayed.** `deposit_with_identity` does not
  check whether the CID is already on the log: the same `(draft, proof)` is appended
  again and charged against the proposer's quota each time, so whoever sees a proposal in
  transit can drain its author's quota. §9.1 lists a duplicate CID as invalid; only
  `lifecycle::deposit` checks it, from a caller-supplied flag. **RESOLVED** (T64):
  `TransparencyLog::contains`; `deposit` and `deposit_with_identity` return
  `DepositRejected::DuplicateCid` before the identity check and the quota charge, and the
  `Propose` proof is bound to `(cid, epoch)` (`deposit::deposit_context`), so it does not
  outlive its epoch — `proto007_deposit_replay.rs`.
- **PROTO-013 — respondents are not identity-gated.** `Role::Respond` appears nowhere in
  `protocol/src`, and the pilot and re-validation gates count `theta.len()` rows as
  distinct respondents: 300 rows from one person satisfy `N1_MIN`. Level B, the final
  verdict, is less Sybil-resistant than Level A. **RESOLVED** (T65): `pilot::submit_response`
  admits a `Respond` proof bound to `(batch, epoch)` into a `NullifierSet`; `screen`,
  `dif_batch` and `revalidate_batch_latent` count that set and refuse rows that are not the
  admitted respondents one to one; `run_epoch` admits one person per fixture row —
  `proto013_respondent_gate.rs` (`AT-PRO-09`).
- **NET-005 (update) — the consortium threshold is not validated, and `verify` ignores the
  member set.** `Consortium::new(members, 0)` verifies a checkpoint with no signature;
  `t > n` never verifies; `Consortium::verify` does not compare the checkpoint's
  `member_set_hash` with its own (only `CheckpointClient` does), although
  `Beacon::from_checkpoint` names `verify` as the check to run. **RESOLVED** (T63,
  2026-09-26): `Consortium::new` panics unless `1 ≤ t ≤ n` with distinct keys (operator
  configuration, `docs/12` §2.2), and `verify` refuses a checkpoint whose `member_set_hash`
  is not its own — `consortium_config.rs` (AT-NET-09).
- **REPUTATION-007 (update) — the appeal stake is not checked and the escrow is never
  settled.** `orchestrator::run_item` sends `Appeal { within_window: true,
  reputation_covers_stake: true }` hard-wired; `gate::settle_appeal` is called only by
  tests. **RESOLVED** (T61, 2026-09-25, D27 as decided): `protocol::appeal::AuthorHistory`
  — `file_appeal` refuses an author whose `C_a` is below the floor (the prior mean,
  `appeal_floor`) and escrows a zero-quality pseudo-observation; `orchestrator::settle_appeal`
  replaces it with the item's measured quality on `ActivePool` and leaves it on any other
  terminal; `run_item` derives the `Appeal` flags from `ItemVerdicts::{appeal_within_window,
  author_reputation, appeal_floor}`; `gate::settle_appeal` (the ledger) is removed.
  `appeal_stake.rs`, `end_to_end.rs` (the reputation after a successful appeal).
- **PROTO-008 (update) — the re-decision uses the same panel.** `gate::supplementary_review`
  re-fits the same ratings. Since bootstrap-min ≤ full fit, the re-decision relaxes the
  robust threshold instead of adding evidence: D26's "more reviewers" is not implemented.
  **RESOLVED** (T60, 2026-09-25): `SupplementaryReview` carries the extra round —
  `Event::AssignExtraReviewers` (one to `K_EXTRA_MAX` distinct nyms outside the first
  panel), then the first round's `Commit`/`CloseCommits`/`Reveal` rules on the same item;
  `Event::Resolve` is refused before the assignment (`NoExtraPanel`) and before every
  extra panelist revealed (`PartialEpoch`); `orchestrator::run_item` walks the round
  (`extra_round`) and re-decides on its reveals folded into the epoch's ratings
  (`expanded_ratings` → `gate::supplementary_review`); `review::assign_extra_from_beacon`
  draws the panel (`K_EXTRA = 4`, provisional, `randomness::EXTRA_REVIEW`), and
  `assign_extra_diverse_from_beacon` keeps it outside the first panel's clusters (T57).
  `supplementary_redecision.rs`: a band item nine reviewers approve just above τ passes
  on the first panel alone and is `Rejected(Borderline)` once four extra reviewers
  disapprove; the model suites carry the round's rules.
- **PROTO-004 (update) — a polarized band item cannot appeal.** `Resolve { passed: false }`
  ends in `Rejected(Borderline)`, where `Appeal` is `UnexpectedEvent`; only items below the
  band reach `AppealEligible`. **RESOLVED** (T59, after the D26 amendment): `Event::Resolve`
  carries the re-decision's `GateOutcome` — `Pass → Pilot1`, `AppealEligible →
  AppealEligible`, `Reject → Rejected(Borderline)`, a second band refused — and
  `gate::supplementary_review` applies the below-band rule on the side gap;
  `supplementary_redecision.rs`, the driver and the two model suites.
- **BRIDGE-009 (evidence).** Two mirror-image partisan items with eight consensual ones,
  default parameters, τ = 0.08 as in `end_to_end.rs`: the gap between the majority's item
  and its mirror is 0.00 / 0.11 / 0.35 / 0.56 at 50/50, 60/40, 80/20, 95/5, and at 95/5 the
  majority's item scores +0.122 (bootstrap-min) and passes. The bootstrap-min leaves the
  gap unchanged, and `|f_j|` falls from 1.58 to 1.05 as the camps become unequal, so the
  appeal signal weakens where it is needed. **RESOLVED** (T49): the gate reads the
  side-balanced score `S_j` and, for the appeal, the side gap; on the same dataset the
  camp-size effect on `S_j` stays within 0.1 at every ratio, neither mirror item passes,
  and the gap stays wide — `side_balanced.rs` (AT-BR-08, AT-BR-09).
- **COLLUSION-005 (evidence).** `cluster_by_correlation` joins on `|ρ| ≥ threshold` by
  connected components, so honest camps on opposite sides of a polarized axis (ρ ≈ −1)
  fall into one cluster. No `collusion` function is called from `protocol` (consistent
  with D40): on the protocol path the cartel defence is the T5 weight alone. → D39, T56.
- **Type holes.** A `Revealing` state built by hand with an empty panel can be scored
  (vacuously "all revealed") → T66, T46. A `Ratings` with an out-of-range observation
  panicked inside the objective instead of returning an error → **RESOLVED** (T62):
  `Ratings::validate`, `fit`/`bridge_scores` return `RatingsError`,
  `malformed_ratings.rs`. `honeypot::inject`
  always injects the *first* `n` golden items, so the traps repeat across epochs → T67.
- **Roadmap id.** `T49` was used twice; the no-show rule is now **T58**.
- **Confirmed residual.** An author can be drawn onto the panel of their own item (§9.1
  `Admitted` row): accepted, since role pseudonyms are unlinkable by design.

## 1. Scope

This specification covers the system described by `docs/00`–`docs/06` and implemented in the Cargo workspace at the audited commit:

- the **scoring engine** (`crates/scoring`): bridging (Level A), IRT and DIF (Level B), reputation (Level C), anti-collusion;
- the **identity layer** (`crates/identity`): enrollment, uniqueness label (single-server VOPRF and threshold OPRF), BBS+ credential (single and threshold issuer), role pseudonyms, ZK nullifier, rate-limiting tokens;
- the **storage/network layer** (`crates/network`): content addressing, Merkle tree, hash-chained log, consortium checkpoints, erasure coding, OpenTimestamps anchoring;
- the **protocol layer** (`crates/protocol`): deposit, lottery, reviewer assignment, commit–reveal, gate and appeal, two-stage pilot, honeypot, probation, re-validation, exposure, blueprint, governance.

Out of scope: user interfaces, deployment tooling, legal/regulatory analysis of eID use, and the political question of whether competence-weighted voting is desirable (`docs/06` L6). The eID adapters (CIE/SPID) are in scope only as interfaces; no adapter performs real document verification at this commit.

---

## 2. System model

### 2.1 What the system claims to guarantee (as stated by the repository)

The repository makes, in `README.md`, `docs/00`–`06`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the following top-level claims. Each is decomposed into numbered claims in §5.

| # | Top-level claim (paraphrased from the docs) | Where stated |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | A question is accepted only if approved *across* the latent fracture axis (bridging), never by majority. | `docs/00`, `docs/01` D1–D2 |
| T2 | The final verdict on a question comes from psychometric statistics on real answers (IRT + DIF), not from opinions. | `docs/01` D3, `docs/02` §B |
| T3 | Bias is detected on *latent* axes without collecting any demographic attribute. | `docs/01` D4, `docs/02` §B.3 |
| T4 | One real person ↔ at most one active pseudonym per role; pseudonyms are non-rotatable and mutually unlinkable; the state authenticates but does not issue. | `docs/03` P1–P3, M1–M3 |
| T5 | Reputation cannot be whitewashed; a coordinated cartel of `k` nodes has influence ≈ `√k`. | `docs/02` §C, §Anti-collusion, `docs/01` D7 |

```

Observations that matter for every later section:

- **The orchestrator exists (T12) and the fixture epoch is routed through it.** `protocol::lifecycle` owns per-item `State` and a `step` transition function that rejects every checkable invalid §9.1 transition (`tests/orchestrator.rs`). The dead `protocol::Stage` enum was removed. `end_to_end.rs::run_epoch` now makes every stage-to-stage decision through `lifecycle::step` via `orchestrator::run_item` (RESOLVED@T12). The `SupplementaryReview` forward transition is now defined (`Event::Resolve`, the D26 re-decision — RESOLVED@T10/T30). Still open: persistence (T13).
- **The protocol crate consumes only `identity::nym::Nym` and `network::{cid, log}`.** It never calls `nullifier::{prove,verify}`, `ratelimit::*`, `credential::*`, `consortium::*`, `merkle::*`, `erasure::*`, or `anchoring::*` (verified by `grep` over `crates/protocol/src`). *(RESOLVED@T6: `protocol::admission` now calls `nullifier::verify` and the `deposit_with_identity`/`submit_review` entry points key on `NullifierProof::id`; see PROTO-007.)*
- **`scoring::bridging::fit` takes no reviewer weights.** Everything Level C and anti-collusion computes (`E_u`, `w_max`, probation weight, `discount_weights`) has no consumer in the Level A objective. *(RESOLVED@T5: the fit minimizes `Σ w_u (r−r̂)²`; `orchestrator::bridging_weights` supplies `w_u`; see BRIDGE-007.)*

## 3. Actors and trust boundaries

### 3.1 Actors

| Actor | Holds | Trusted for | Must NOT be trusted for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Person** (holder) | `Credential.secret` (32 bytes), `AnonymousCredential` (BBS+ signature over `(x, label)`) | Keeping its secret; nothing else | Honesty of ratings, answers, or drafts |
| **Identity source** (CIE/SPID IdP; the state) | Knowledge of `codice fiscale` ↔ person; knowledge that a person enrolled (F1) | Asserting "this is a real, unique person" | Not linking person ↔ label ↔ pseudonyms (design goal, see PRIV-002) |
| **Issuing committee** (`n` members, threshold `t`) | Shamir shares of the OPRF key (`oprf::KeyShare`) and of the BBS+ key (`ThresholdIssuer.key_shares`) | Correct evaluation/signing when `≥ t` honest | Any coalition `≥ t` can brute-force the anchor space (docs/03 M1) and issue arbitrary credentials |
| **Label registry** (unspecified custodian) | `EnrollmentRegistry.used: HashSet<Label>` | Dedup | Unspecified — see ID-005 |
| **Storage consortium** (`n` signers, threshold `t`) | ed25519 `SigningKey` per `consortium::Member` | Signing the true log head | Any coalition `≥ t` can sign a false head or equivocate (NET-006) |
| **Anchoring service** (OTS calendar + Bitcoin) | — | Time-ordering of roots | Availability |
| **Scoring re-runner** (anyone) | Full ratings + answers | Recomputing scores | Receives all voting patterns (PRIV-004) |
| **Sortition committee** (honeypot / blueprint / parameters) | Knowledge of which items are golden | Producing golden items | Reviewing their own golden items (PROTO-009) |
| **Founder set** | Declared `Nym`s with weight 1 | Bootstrap outcomes | Long-term weight without a track record (probation applies at 200) |

### 3.2 Trust boundaries (as they exist in the code)

| Boundary | Design requirement | Status in code |
|---|---|---|
| Identity source ↔ issuing committee | Never communicate; the state does not see the label | No representation. `EnrollmentRegistry::enroll(doc, oracle)` receives the *cleartext* anchor and the oracle in the same call. |
| Holder ↔ committee (OPRF) | Committee sees only the blinded element | `UniquenessOracle::label(&self, anchor: &Anchor)` — the key-holder receives the cleartext anchor. Obliviousness is exercised inside the method, not enforced by the interface. |
| Holder ↔ committee (issuance) | Committee sees only the commitment and the label | Enforced: `Issuer::issue(&IssuanceRequest)` receives `commitment`, `label`, PoK; the secret is never passed. |
| Issuing committee ↔ storage consortium | Preferably distinct (D15) | No representation. |
| Pseudonym ↔ credential | Every action carries a ZK proof | `protocol` accepts a bare `Nym` (32 bytes) with no proof. |
| Signer ↔ verifier | Anyone re-runs the computation | No serialization of the engine input exists; "same input" is not defined (REPRO-002). |

### 3.3 Threat actors assumed by the documentation

`docs/03` D9 requires anonymity to hold **against a state-level actor**. `docs/06` assumes: majority factions, cartels of coordinated real persons, a dishonest signer, a betraying consortium, and a colluding issuing committee below threshold. The documentation does not state assumptions about: the label-registry custodian, the source of protocol randomness, the re-runner of the computation, or a compromised holder device. This specification adds them (§12).

---

## 4. Invariants

The eight invariants of `docs/CLAUDE.md` are restated here as runtime invariants with their actual enforcement point. "Enforced" means a code path makes the violation impossible or detectable; "asserted" means only a comment or a test example states it.

| # | Invariant (normative form) | Enforcement at `c4a09b1` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| INV-1 | No personal, demographic, or affiliation attribute MUST enter any data structure processed by the engine. | No such field exists. **However** `dif::logistic_dif`, `pilot::stage2_dif`, `revalidation::revalidate_pool` take an arbitrary caller-supplied `group`/`axes` vector per respondent; nothing prevents a caller from passing a declared attribute. The fixtures do exactly that (`levelb_grp.csv` is an observed ±1 label). | Asserted, not enforced |
| INV-2 | Item acceptance MUST NOT be a majority-vote count. | `gate::bridging_gate` uses `b_j`; no vote count exists. `governance::change_approved` is a 2/3 vote but applies to meta-level changes only. | Enforced for items |
| INV-3 | No monetary stake MUST exist. | No money type exists. The appeal's stake is a quality observation inside `C_a` (`appeal::AuthorHistory`, D27, T61). | Enforced |
| INV-4 | `C_a` and `E_u` MUST live on different pseudonyms and MUST NOT be combined. | Separate functions; `Role::Propose` vs `Role::Judge`. No code combines them. No code *binds* a score to a role either (scores are bare `f64`s in tests). | Enforced by absence |
| INV-5 | One deterministic, non-rotatable pseudonym per role. | `nym::derive_nym` and `nullifier::prove` are both deterministic in `(secret, role)`. Rotation is prevented only if a second credential is impossible (ID-001…ID-005). | Enforced for derivation; depends on identity layer |
| INV-6 | The authenticator (state) MUST be distinct from the issuer (committee). | Distinct types (`IdentityDocument` vs `Issuer`). No protocol message separates them; see §3.2. | Asserted |
| INV-7 | Same input ⇒ bit-identical output. | `tests/reproducibility.rs` (same process, same binary); `tests/golden.rs` pins every output on the fixtures bit for bit, and CI checks it on linux-gnu (dev and release), linux-musl, macOS-aarch64 and Windows-MSVC (AT-BR-04); the transcendental functions come from the pure-Rust `libm` crate (`scoring::fmath`), not from the platform's libm. "Input" has no canonical serialization; see REPRO-001/002. | Tested within a process and across platforms and profiles (AT-BR-04) |
| INV-8 | Level-B validation MUST run on batches, never a single item. | ENFORCED (T9) at the batch-admission gates: `pilot::{admit_dif_batch, dif_batch}` and `revalidation::revalidate_batch_latent` reject a batch below `K_MIN` items, a sample below its §B.6 floor and — the latent re-check — anchors whose KR-20 is below `KR20_MIN` (D37, T53), counting admitted respondents (`NullifierSet::len`), never rows (T65); `run_epoch` runs the pilot through them. The per-item math (`stage2_dif`, `mixture_dif`) stays available for calibration probes. | Enforced |

Additional invariants this specification introduces (not in `docs/CLAUDE.md`), each derived from a gap found in §10:

| # | Invariant | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| INV-9 | Every `Nym` accepted by the protocol MUST be accompanied by a verified `NullifierProof` for the same role, and the protocol MUST key reputation and rate limits on `NullifierProof::nullifier()`, not on `nym::derive_nym`. | ENFORCED at the entry points (T6, T65): `admission::admit` + `deposit_with_identity`/`submit_review`/`pilot::submit_response` key on `NullifierProof::id()`; PROTO-007, PROTO-013 |
| INV-10 | The seed of every lottery, reviewer assignment, honeypot placement, and sortition MUST be derived from public randomness that is fixed *after* the set of candidates is fixed and that no participant can influence. | ENFORCED (T8, T37): every draw's seed comes from the epoch's commit-reveal beacon (`randomness::Beacon::from_outcome`, §9.4, D41), committed by the consortium members before the deposits close and revealed after, so neither a draft nor the log's content or order moves it, and the lottery reads the deposit set in canonical order; residual: the last revealer's choice between two values at the cost of a public non-reveal (D41, §18); CRYPTO-008 |
| INV-11 | The uniqueness-label key (OPRF key) MUST NOT be rotated without a documented migration that preserves dedup; the label MUST be stable for the lifetime of the registry. | ID-006 |
| INV-12 | A commitment in commit–reveal MUST bind the committer's nullifier and the item CID. | ENFORCED (T7): `review::commit = H(prob, nonce, committer, item)`; the reveal recomputes against the revealer + item; CRYPTO-007 |
| INV-13 | The engine input MUST have a canonical serialization (fixed observation order, fixed float encoding) and the reproducibility claim MUST be stated relative to it. | REPRO-002 |
| INV-14 | The `(Σw)^α` group transform MUST NOT increase any node's weight. | COLLUSION-004 |

---

## 5. Formal claims

Each critical claim carries the full block required by `docs/07` §4. Secondary claims appear in compact form and in the matrix (§15). Statuses are the lowest justified by the evidence cited.

### 5.1 Reproducibility

#### REPRO-001 — Bit-for-bit determinism of the engine
- **Claim.** For fixed `Ratings` (same `n`, `m`, and `obs` *in the same order*), fixed `BridgingParams`, fixed toolchain, fixed target triple and libm, `bridging::fit`, `bridging::bridge_scores`, and `dif::mixture_dif` return bit-identical `f64`s across runs.
- **Preconditions.** Same binary, same platform. Same `obs` order.
- **Assumptions.** `f64::{ln, cos, exp, ln_1p, sqrt, powf}` are deterministic on the platform; no SIMD auto-vectorization reorders reductions between builds (`codegen-units = 1`, no fast-math).
- **Invariant.** No `HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration, no timestamps, no unseeded RNG in `crates/scoring` (verified by reading: RNG is `ChaCha8Rng::seed_from_u64` with explicit consumption order; all reductions are sequential loops).
- **Failure condition.** `to_bits()` inequality on any output for identical input on the same platform.
- **Evidence.** `crates/scoring/tests/reproducibility.rs` (3 tests, same process). `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` `codegen-units = 1`, `lto = "thin"`; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.86.0.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED (within one process on one platform). **Cross-platform / cross-libm reproducibility: NOT ESTABLISHED.** `ln`, `cos`, `exp`, `ln_1p` lower to the platform libm (glibc vs musl vs macOS differ in last-ulp behaviour); no test runs on two platforms. Note the release profile is not what `cargo test` uses; the reproducibility tests run under the `test` profile with default `codegen-units`.

#### REPRO-002 — Input canonicalization
- **Claim.** The output of `fit` depends only on the *set* of observations, not their order.
- **Failure condition.** Permuting `Ratings.obs` changes any output bit.
- **Evidence.** None. The gradient and cost accumulate in `obs` order; floating-point addition is not associative, so permutation invariance at the bit level is expected to **fail**. `crates/scoring/tests/level_a.rs:152-165` already builds `obs` from a `HashSet` iteration (`for &u in &boosters`), so that test's fit is order-randomized per process (its assertions are inequalities, so it passes regardless).
- **Evidence status.** NOT ESTABLISHED. The reproducibility contract MUST be stated relative to a canonical ordering (e.g. sort `obs` by `(u, j)`) — INV-13 — and a permutation test MUST assert either bit-equality after canonicalization or bounded divergence (`|Δb_j| < 1e-9`) without.

#### REPRO-003 — Oracle equivalence with the Python simulations
- **Claim.** The Rust engine reproduces the simulations' results on the same input.
- **Preconditions.** Fixtures in `crates/scoring/tests/fixtures/` generated by `sim/export_fixtures.py`.
- **Evidence.** `level_a.rs`: `|b_j − b_j^{sim}| < 0.03`, `|μ − 0.7552| < 0.02`, axis corr > 0.98. `level_b.rs`: `r_pbis`, `β₂` within 0.02. `level_c.rs`: BSS within 1e-6. `mixture_*`: qualitative (means, sign of BIC).
- **Audit finding (auditor-executed).** Regenerating the fixtures with numpy 2.4.4 / scipy 1.17.1 changes `bj_full` by up to **1.0e-3** and `mu_hat` by 1.9e-4 relative to the committed `expected_levelA.csv`/`expected_meta.csv` (19 + 1 tokens outside the `fixture_drift` tolerance `1e-4 + 1e-4·|x|`). The data files (`R.csv`, `mask.csv`, all Level-B/C/mixture inputs) regenerate **exactly**. The drift is in SciPy's L-BFGS-B (rewritten in C in SciPy 1.15) stopping point, i.e. the "oracle" is defined only to ≈1e-3 in `b_j`. The ignored test `crates/scoring/tests/fixture_drift.rs::committed_fixtures_match_the_sims` would fail in this environment.
- **Consequence.** With `τ = 0.08` and `ε = 0.008`, three items of the oracle dataset sit within 0.004 of `τ` (`b_j` = 0.0812, 0.0801, 0.0837 for items 02, 06, 07). A 1e-3 oracle uncertainty and a 3e-2 acceptance tolerance mean **verdict-level agreement near the threshold is not tested and not testable at the current tolerances.** `end_to_end.rs` confirms a verdict disagreement: the sim places item 02 in the pool, the Rust pipeline does not (`EXPECTED_POOL = [0, 6]`, comment at lines 30–37), because the Rust screen adds `a ≥ 0.6` on a 2PL fit the sim never performs.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED at the statistic level within loose tolerances; **REPRODUCED: NO** (the auditor could not reproduce the committed oracle values from the sims to the repository's own tolerance); verdict-level equivalence NOT ESTABLISHED.
- **T45 (2026-09-25) — differential oracles on random datasets.** `differential_oracle.rs` runs the paper's NumPy/SciPy implementations (`paper/scripts/common.py`, analytic gradients, L-BFGS-B at `gtol 1e-10`) through `sim/oracle_bridging.py` and `sim/oracle_mixture.py` on datasets the Rust tests generate, both sides from seeded multi-starts keeping the lowest objective. Bridging, six random two-camp datasets (12–40 reviewers, 5–12 items, densities 0.5–0.9, uniform and random weights with a zero): the engine's objective is never worse than the oracle's (1e-6 relative) and all six land in the same basin — the objectives agree to nine decimals and `μ`, `b_j`, `f_j` to 1e-3. The proxy-θ mixture, four random batches (500–1,200 respondents, 5–8 items, 0–4 shifted): the one-class fits agree to 1e-6 relative, the engine's two-class uniform candidate is never worse than the oracle's (1e-4 relative on the BIC), and the two-class BICs agree to four decimals on all four; on the two batches where the BIC selects two classes the gaps are the oracle's `2|d|` to 0.05. The suite self-skips without the pinned environment and runs in CI, which installs it (`sim/requirements.txt`); the fixed-fixture oracles of `level_{a,b,c}.rs` and the drift guard stand as before.

#### REPRO-004 — Fixture provenance
- **Claim.** Committed fixtures are immutable known-answer data with documented provenance.
- **Evidence.** `sim/export_fixtures.py` (seeds 7, 0, 100+s, 200). No numpy/scipy versions are recorded anywhere; `fixture_drift` is `#[ignore]` and not run in CI.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED. The fixtures SHOULD record the exact numpy/scipy versions and SHOULD be regenerated in CI under a pinned environment, or the oracle tolerance SHOULD be widened to the observed drift with an explicit justification.

### 5.2 Bridging (Level A)

#### BRIDGE-001 — Model and objective match the specification
- **Claim.** `bridging::fit_with_init` minimizes `L = Σ_Ω (r_uj − μ − b_u − b_j − f_u f_j)² + λ_b(Σb_u² + Σb_j²) + λ_f(Σf_u² + Σf_j²)` with `d = 1`.
- **Evidence.** Code inspection of `crates/scoring/src/bridging.rs:152-190`: cost and analytic gradient match `sim/bridging_irt_dif.py::fit` term by term (gradient factor 2 included in both). `μ` is unregularized in both.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (oracle). `d = 2` (docs/02 §A.4) DESCOPED (D31, recorded by T39). `n_min = 30` IMPLEMENTED (T39, 2026-09-25): `Ratings::axis` keeps an off-axis reviewer out of the core fit — the axis, the item levels and everyone else's position are bit for bit those of the fit without it — and places it on the fixed axis by ridge least squares over its own ratings, so it fills the space without defining it; `orchestrator::axis_mask` sets the mask from the reviews on record (`N_MIN_REVIEWS = 30`, founders always on the axis); `side_balanced` forms the sides from the axis reviewers only (`reviewer_floor.rs`: a sleeper with three extreme ratings gets the position its ratings say, −0.5, and moves nothing; on the axis it moves `f_j`; with every reviewer on the axis the fit is bit-identical to the unmasked one). Pinning `f_u` at 0 was tried and rejected: the model's translation invariance `(f_u, b_j) → (f_u + c, b_j − c·f_j)` let one pinned sleeper drag the axis's origin by 0.2.

- **Post-audit (T42, 2026-09-24) — the fit is not a reliable minimizer.** (1) `random_init` took the start value of `μ` from the *unweighted* mean of all ratings, so a zero-weight (probation) reviewer could move the start point and, on this non-convex objective, the minimum reached: on one random 7×5 case `b_j` moved by 0.135. Fixed (weighted mean; bit-identical with uniform weights); `properties.rs::a_zero_weight_reviewer_is_the_same_as_an_absent_one` now holds bit-for-bit. (2) **RESOLVED@T48 (see below):** the result depended on the seed. On random matrices 8 seeds disagree on some `b_j` by > 0.01 in 57–84% of cases (more often with more reviewers); on one 7×5 case two genuine local minima give `b_j` = 0.081 and 0.130 either side of `τ = 0.08`. On the 200×10 fixture 7 of 8 seeds agree, but seed 5 stops at an objective of 24.6 against 6.32 with `b_j` up to 1.08, reported `Converged` with `‖∇‖_∞ = 3.8e-4` (`g_tol = 1e-7`): the relative-progress stall criterion ends a slow Armijo-only descent in a narrow valley (OPT-001, §6.2). The seed-0 fit on the fixture also stops at `‖∇‖_∞ = 7e-5` — acceptable there (Rust matches SciPy to 0.002) but not guaranteed elsewhere.

- **T48 (2026-09-24).** Measurements separated the two causes: among starts that reach the same objective, `b_j` agree to ≤ 7e-5, so the disagreement came from *distinct* minima, not imprecision; the Armijo stall only made a bad start worse. Fix: (a) `lbfgs` now uses a strong-Wolfe line search (below, §6.2); (b) `fit` runs `n_starts = 8` seeded starts (`seed + k`) and keeps the lowest objective, then fixes the sign of `f` (largest `|f_j|` non-negative). Disjoint seed sets now disagree on some `b_j` by > 0.01 in 2 of 300 random cases (105 of 300 with one start); on the fixture 8 base seeds agree to 1e-4 (`level_a.rs::bridging_scores_do_not_depend_on_the_seed`), while a single start from seed 5 still lands in the minimum with `b_j[08] ≈ 1.08` (`::a_single_start_can_land_in_a_worse_minimum`). Cost: the fixture fit takes ~66 ms instead of ~7 ms (release). Golden outputs regenerated: `b_j` moved by ≤ 1e-5, the bootstrap scores by ≤ 5e-5, and `f` changed sign to the canonical one.

#### BRIDGE-002 — Latent axis recovery
- **Claim.** On the fixture dataset (N=200, 60/40 split, `true_f ~ N(±1, 0.25)`, M=10, 9 ratings/node), `|corr(f_u, true_f)| > 0.98`.
- **Assumptions.** Data generated by the sim's own linear model `R = q + 0.45·f·lean + sev + N(0, 0.07)`, clipped to [0,1]. The recovered axis is the axis the generator planted.
- **Failure condition.** corr ≤ 0.98 on this dataset; or corr materially lower on any dataset with the same generating process and a different seed (untested).
- **Evidence.** `level_a.rs::fit_reproduces_oracle_on_identical_dataset`; auditor re-run of the sim gives 0.990.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED on one seed. **SCIENTIFICALLY_CHARACTERIZED: NO** — no sweep over seeds, split ratios, noise, sparsity, `k`, or model misspecification (non-linear rating behaviour, multi-axis populations, `d=1` fit to a `d=2` world).

#### BRIDGE-003 — Asymmetric regularization discards polarized items
- **Claim.** Items with large `|f_j|` obtain `b_j < τ`; cross-cutting items obtain `b_j ≥ τ`.
- **Evidence.** `level_a.rs::asymmetric_regularization_separates_bridging_from_majority` (items 2,7,8,9 below τ with `|f_j| > 0.4`; items 0,3,4 above τ with `|f_j| < 0.4`).
- **Caveat.** This is a property of the generating process (lean ∈ {0, ±0.75, ±0.8, 0.3, 0.05}) plus the parameter pair (0.15, 0.03) plus `τ = 0.08`, all chosen after looking at the same dataset (`docs/02` §A.3 says τ "proved" to be 0.08 "in testing"). Per `docs/07` §13 this is not evidence of correctness for any other dataset.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED on one dataset. Parameter calibration procedure NOT ESTABLISHED.

#### BRIDGE-004 — Bootstrap-min is pessimistic and stable
- **Claim.** `bridge_scores(·, m=10, keep=0.85)[j] ≤ fit(·).b_j[j]` for all `j`, and the min reflects sampling variability rather than optimizer multimodality.
- **Evidence.** First half: `level_a.rs::bootstrap_min_is_pessimistic` — but it is **true by construction**: `bridge_scores` initializes `best = full.b_j` and only lowers it (`bridging.rs:217, 236-240`), so the assertion cannot fail. This deviates from the sim, which takes the min over the 10 subsample fits only. Second half (warm-start suppresses spurious minima): asserted in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, not tested — no test compares warm-started vs. cold-started bootstrap spread.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED; the pessimism test is tautological; multimodality claim HYPOTHESIS.

#### BRIDGE-005 — Cost of bipartisan corruption
- **Claim (docs/06).** With 40 own-camp boosters, a partisan item needs "70 of 80 (87%)" opposing-camp boosters to pass bridging, versus ~40 own-camp under majority vote.
- **Evidence.** `level_a.rs::corner_case_bipartisan_corruption_cost` asserts only monotonicity and `s70 > s0 + 0.2`, not the 87% figure. Auditor re-run of the sim: crossing occurs between 55 and 70 boosters with the sim's random selection; with deterministic first-`n` selection (as the Rust test does) the item passes at **55 of 80 (69%)** (`b_j = +0.081`). Majority vote with 40 own-camp boosters: plain mean 0.624 ≥ 0.60 → passes (auditor-computed; the sim asserts this in text but never computes it).
- **Evidence status.** Qualitative claim (need a large share of the *opposing* camp) TESTED on one dataset. The "87%" figure is sample-dependent and overstated; the correct statement is "≈ 55–70 of 80 depending on which nodes are corrupted". SCIENTIFICALLY_CHARACTERIZED: NO.

#### BRIDGE-006 — Uncertainty band
- **Claim.** Items with `b_j ∈ [τ−ε, τ+ε]` go to supplementary review.
- **Evidence.** `gate::bridging_gate` returns `SupplementaryReview`; the D26 re-decision `gate::supplementary_review` re-runs bridging over the (expanded) panel and decides `b_j` against the plain threshold τ; `lifecycle` resolves the state via `Event::Resolve`. `supplementary_redecision.rs`.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T10/T30 (was IMPLEMENTED as a label only). Semantics now defined: more reviewers → re-run bridging → decide `b_j` vs τ (a bridging decision, not a vote); polarized items 07/08 are not passed. The "more reviewers" are real since T60: `Event::AssignExtraReviewers` and the extra round in `SupplementaryReview`, the reveals folded into the ratings (`orchestrator::expanded_ratings`) before `gate::supplementary_review` (`supplementary_redecision.rs::the_extra_reviewers_change_the_re_decision`).

#### BRIDGE-007 — Reviewer weights enter the aggregation
- **Claim (docs/02 §C.2, §Anti-collusion, docs/05 §Cold start).** `E_u` weights the review vote; the cartel discount reduces a cartel's influence on `b_j`; probation nodes have weight 0.
- **Evidence.** `bridging::fit` has no weight parameter. `discount_weights`, `capped_weight`, `review_weight` produce numbers no consumer uses. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §Future work acknowledges this.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED (T5). `bridging::fit` minimizes the weighted objective `Σ w_u (r−r̂)²` over `Ratings.weights = discount(cap(E_u))` (probation = 0); `anti_collusion.rs::at_col_06_cartel_moves_the_bridge_score_less_than_independents` shows a discounted cartel moves `b_j` less than the same number of independents. Still to wire: per-epoch recomputation from the *previous* epoch's outcomes in a real orchestrator (T12).

#### OPT-001 — Optimizer convergence is observable
- **Claim.** A caller can tell whether `optim::lbfgs` converged.
- **Evidence.** `lbfgs` returns `Vec<f64>` only; hitting `max_iters`, the `step < 1e-20` exit, and the "not a descent direction" exit are indistinguishable from convergence. `fit_logistic` under complete separation (possible for any item with perfect θ-separation, or for the 4-parameter DIF model on small strata) will run to `max_iters` and return finite but arbitrary large coefficients, which then feed `|β₂| > 0.40` decisions.
- **Evidence status.** NOT IMPLEMENTED. `lbfgs` MUST return a status (`Converged{iters}`, `MaxIters`, `LineSearchFailed`) and callers MUST propagate it into verdicts.
- **What a stall-reported `Converged` guarantees (T45, 2026-09-25).** The run also stops on a relative progress below `1e-12 · (1 + |f|)`, and then `‖g‖_∞` can be far above `g_tol`: for a quadratic model the last step's decrease is at least `‖g‖² / (2 λ_max)`, so at a stall `‖g‖_∞ ≤ √(2 λ_max · 1e-12 · (1 + |f|))` — about `1.4e-4 · √λ_max` near `f = 0`. `optim.rs::a_stall_convergence_leaves_the_gradient_within_its_bound` pins the bound on condition-10² to 10⁶ quadratics and on Rosenbrock from three starts with an unattainable `g_tol`, and the minimizer is reached to the precision the bound allows. A caller who needs a small gradient must read `g_tol` as the target and the stall as a floor set by the objective's curvature.

### 5.3 IRT and DIF (Level B)

#### IRT-001 — Ability proxy
- **Claim.** `θ_i` is the standardized total score on anchor items (`irt::theta_from_anchors`).
- **Evidence.** Code; matches `th` in both sims.
- **Note.** This is a classical proxy, not an IRT ability estimate. `standardize` divides by the population SD and returned NaN if all totals are equal (now: θ ≡ 0 with no spread, and `point_biserial` = 0 with no variance, which fails the screen — T36, `degenerate_inputs.rs`). All downstream thresholds (`A_MIN`, `BETA2_MAX`, `MIXTURE_DIF_MAX`) are therefore expressed in "logits per SD of anchor total", not in the IRT θ metric from which the literature values were taken.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED. The metric mismatch is a specification ambiguity (§14 G-07).

#### IRT-002 — Point-biserial catches inverted keys
- **Claim.** An item with an inverted key has `r_pbis < 0`.
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::verdicts_match_the_oracle` (item 06: −0.356). Follows from the definition when the key is fully inverted and the item discriminates.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED.

#### IRT-003 — 2PL discrimination screen
- **Claim.** `fit_2pl_item` returns `a` such that `a ≥ 0.6` retains discriminating items.
- **Status (T34).** `fit_2pl_item` now returns `Fit2pl { a, b, status }`; `pilot::stage1_screen` fails an item whose fit is not `Converged`, so a separated item's diverging slope no longer passes `a ≥ A_MIN` (`lifecycle.rs::pilot_stage1_fails_an_item_whose_2pl_fit_is_separated`).
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::irt_2pl_discrimination_ranks_items` (ranking + one item below 0.6). `end_to_end.rs` documents that item 02 (generated as 3PL with guessing floor 0.25 in the sim) fails the screen; the test rationalizes this as 3PL-vs-2PL, but the θ-metric mismatch (IRT-001) is an equally plausible cause and is not separated out.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (2 items). Threshold validity NOT ESTABLISHED. 3PL, `c ≤ 0.35`, `|b| ≤ 2.5` (constant `B_ABS_MAX` exists, unused), infit/outfit: NOT IMPLEMENTED.

#### DIF-001 — Logistic DIF numerics
- **Claim.** `dif::logistic_dif` returns the unpenalized MLE of `logit P = β₀ + β₁θ + β₂g + β₃θg`.
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::point_biserial_and_logistic_dif_reproduce_oracle` (`|β₂ − β₂^{sim}| < 0.02` on 10 items).
- **Evidence status.** TESTED. No standard errors, no test statistic, no multiple-testing control (§7.4).

#### DIF-002 — Variant 1 has an admissible input under the anonymity invariants
- **Claim (docs/02 §B.3).** The group variable `f_i` for respondent `i` is "the Level A latent axis".
- **Analysis.** Level A estimates `f_u` for **judge** pseudonyms. Respondents answer under the **respond** pseudonym, which is unlinkable to the judge pseudonym by INV-4/INV-5 (P3). Therefore no component can supply `f_i` for a respondent without either (a) linking roles (violates P3) or (b) an observed attribute (violates INV-1). The fixtures use an observed ±1 label (`levelb_grp.csv`); the sims call it `grp` and `edu`, i.e. observed groups.
- **Failure condition.** Any deployment that runs `pilot::stage2_dif` or `revalidate_pool` with a per-respondent group vector obtained without violating P3 or INV-1. None is described.
- **Evidence status.** **NOT ESTABLISHED.** At this commit, Variant 1 (`logistic_dif`, `mantel_haenszel`, `purify_theta`, `pilot::stage2_dif`, `revalidation::revalidate_pool`) is usable only in a pilot with declared attributes. Only Variant 2 is anonymity-compatible. This is the single most consequential gap in the specification (§14 G-01).

#### DIF-003 — Mantel–Haenszel classification
- **Claim.** `mantel_haenszel` computes `α_MH = Σ A_s D_s/N_s ÷ Σ B_s C_s/N_s` over `n_strata` equal-frequency θ strata and classifies by `Δ_MH = −2.35 ln α_MH` with ETS cut-offs 1.0 / 1.5.
- **Evidence.** Code inspection (correct formula); `level_b.rs::mantel_haenszel_classifies_dif` (2 items, 5 strata).
- **Deviations from spec.** Spec says "discretizing `f` into tertiles"; code dichotomizes `group > 0.0`. ETS classification also requires a significance test for B/C (MH χ²); none is computed. Zero cells give `α = ∞` or `0` and `|Δ| = ∞` → class C without warning. `sort_by(partial_cmp().unwrap())` panics on NaN θ.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (2 items). Spec/implementation mismatch on stratification.

#### DIF-004 — Latent-class mixture detects batch-level bias
- **Claim.** With NT = 3000, K = 8, `a ~ U(1, 1.5)`, `b ~ N(0, 0.6)`, planted `δ = 0.9` on ≥ 2 items and a hidden balanced ±1 axis, the 2-class mixture yields `|δ̂| ≈ 1.0` on biased items, ≈ 0.1 on clean, BIC > 0, and `|corr(posterior, axis)| ∈ [0.5, 0.8]`.
- **Assumptions.** Exactly two latent classes, balanced; one common hidden axis for all biased items; θ known up to the anchor proxy; item parameters equal across classes except for the shift `δ_j`; local independence.
- **Failure condition.** On data satisfying the assumptions: `|δ̂|` on biased items < 0.5 or on clean items > 0.5 or BIC ≤ 0 with ≥ 2 biased items.
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::mixture_detects_bias_in_a_batch` (3/8, one seed); `end_to_end.rs::pool_revalidation_flags_latent_bias` (allows 1 false positive in 5); auditor re-ran `sim/latent_dif_and_capacity.py`: 1/8 → 0.33 vs 0.35 (invisible), 2/8 → 1.03 vs 0.12 (BIC 100), 3/8 → 1.03 vs 0.09, axis corr 0.50 → 0.80. The ignored `power.rs` uses **5 seeds** per condition (insufficient for a power estimate) and never runs the 0-biased condition (no false-positive rate).
- **Evidence status.** TESTED and REPRODUCED (by the auditor, in the sim) in the tested regime. SCIENTIFICALLY_CHARACTERIZED: NO (no FP rate, no unbalanced classes, no `G ≠ 2`, no `δ < 0.9`, no non-uniform DIF, no multi-axis, no misspecified θ).

- **T40 (2026-09-24).** The detector now fits the specified model `σ(a_jg(θ − b_jg))`: `G ∈ {1..4}` and shared vs per-class `a` chosen by BIC (staged: a larger `G` is tried only while the BIC improves), 4 seeded starts per candidate, an analytic gradient (pinned against central differences; the old numerical one needed ~50 NLL passes per gradient), classes under 5% excluded from the gap. On the fixtures it selects 2 classes, uniform, with the same gaps as before (batch: 2.21/2.22/2.02 vs ≤ 0.33; single: all 0.56–0.91, none flagged). New evidence (`scoring/tests/latent_classes.rs`): clean data → 1 class; a three-way shift → the shifted items gapped > 1.2, others < 0.3 (the BIC settles on 2 classes); a discrimination shift → non-uniform selected, `a_gap` > 1 on the shifted items; the selected model is seed-independent. **Open:** power for non-uniform DIF is limited at N = 3000, K = 8 (on a second dataset the BIC chose a uniform model with a 9% class), and the verdict ignores `a_gap` — no threshold is specified (T24/T25).

#### DIF-005 — A single biased item is unidentifiable (INV-8 rationale)
- **Claim.** With 1/8 biased, the detector cannot separate it.
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::mixture_misses_a_single_biased_item` (asserts axis corr < 0.35); sim: `δ̂` = 0.33 on the biased item vs 0.35 on clean items.
- **Note.** The clean-item `δ̂` of 0.35 in this regime is only 0.15 below the Rust rejection threshold; the false-positive margin at small batches is thin and uncharacterized.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED (encodes a limitation as an assertion; a better detector would break this test, which should be inverted into a documentation claim rather than a guard).

#### DIF-006 — Mixture rejection threshold is consistent across docs, sim, and code
- **Analysis.** Model: `logit P = a_j(θ − b_j − δ_j z)`, `z ∈ {−1,+1}` ⇒ class difficulties `b_j ± δ_j` ⇒ `max_{g,h}|b_jg − b_jh| = 2|δ_j|`. `docs/02` rejects at `DIF_j > 0.5` (on the b-gap). `sim/latent_dif_and_capacity.py` declares "DETECTED" at mean `|δ̂| > 0.35` (batch-level, not per item). `scoring::dif::MIXTURE_DIF_MAX = 0.5` is applied to `|δ̂|` in `revalidation::revalidate_pool_latent` (per item) — i.e. 1.0 logit on the b-gap, **twice** the documented cut-off.
- **Evidence status.** INCONSISTENT at the audit snapshot. **RESOLVED@T35 (metric) / OPEN (value):** `MixtureDif::dif` now reports `DIF_j = 2|δ̂_j|`, and `revalidation::latent_flags` rejects at `MIXTURE_DIF_MAX = 1.0` on the gap — the behaviour the code always had, now stated on the specified quantity — and flags nothing when the free fit did not converge or `BIC ≤ 0`. The literature 0.5 is not adopted: on the one-biased-item fixture `BIC = +32` and every item's gap is 0.56–0.91, so 0.5 would retire all eight (`latent_revalidation.rs`). `docs/02` §B.3 records 1.0 as provisional; the value is set by the FP/FN study (T24/T25). On the target model (T54, `LatentDif::flags`, the same rule) the null gaps are 0 — one class selected — and the campaign gaps 1.7–1.9 for a true 1.8, so 1.0 separates them with margin; still provisional.

#### DIF-007 — Purification reaches a fixed point
- **Claim.** `validation::purify_theta` returns a flagged set that is a fixed point of the flag→re-estimate map.
- **Evidence.** `level_b.rs::purification_reaches_a_stable_flagged_set` re-runs DIF with the returned θ and checks equality.
- **Deviations.** Spec §B.4 estimates θ on anchors only ("30 anchor items external to the batch"); code adds currently-clean batch items to the total each round, changing the θ metric between rounds and relative to the sim. Non-convergence (oscillation) is returned silently with `iterations == max_rounds`.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED (one dataset). Convergence guarantee NOT ESTABLISHED (the map is not monotone; oscillation is possible in principle).

#### DIF-008 — False-positive / false-negative characterization
- **Evidence status.** NOT ESTABLISHED for every detector (Variant 1 thresholds 0.40, MH 1.5, mixture 0.5). No simulation family in the repository measures FP or FN rates at any sample size. `docs/07` §14 lists this as a minimum expectation. **PARTLY ESTABLISHED for the target model (T54, `AT-DIF-01`):** 0 of 120 clean items flagged and no batch with a mixture over 15 null batches — 20, 40 and 60 anchors (KR-20 0.79–0.94), four seeds at N = 3,000 and one at N = 12,000 (`latent_target_model.rs`, `calibration`); the full surface (≥ 200 seeds per cell, the power table) is T24/T25.

#### DIF-009 — Whole-pool mixture re-validation is computable
- **Claim.** `revalidate_pool_latent` can run over "the whole active pool".
- **Analysis.** `mixture_dif` uses a central-difference gradient: `2(1+3m)` NLL evaluations per gradient, each `O(NT·m)`, for up to 3000 iterations. For `m = 8, NT = 3000`: ~10⁹ flops per fit (fine). For a pool of `m = 300`: ~10¹⁴ per fit — infeasible. The two-class, one-axis model is also assumed to hold for *all* pool items simultaneously.
- **Evidence status.** NOT ESTABLISHED at pool scale. The specification MUST bound batch size for this detector or require an analytic gradient and a batched design. Since T40 the proxy model has an analytic gradient; the target model (T54) evaluates every transcendental function per node and item, never per respondent — a pass over the batch is `O(N · Q · G)` exponentials plus sums — so its cost is linear in the batch: on one core (dev profile, `scoring` at opt-level 3) 8–32 s per 8-item null batch at N = 3,000, 90–110 s at N = 12,000, 15–25 s at N = 6,000, and 75–90 s for a campaign batch at N = 6,000 whose BIC search reaches three classes. The pool is re-checked in batches of `K_MIN`+ items (`revalidate_batch_latent`), never as one fit over hundreds of items.

#### STAT-001 — Sample sizes 300 / 1500 / 3000 are adequate
- **Claim (docs/02 §B.6).** Pilot 1 ≈ 300, Pilot 2 ≈ 1500 (with group signal) or ≈ 3000 (latent-class).
- **Evidence.** Literature rules of thumb cited in prose; `power.rs` (ignored, 5 seeds, 2 of 8 biased, `δ = 0.9`); the sim uses NT = 1500 for Variant 1 and 3000 for Variant 2. `docs/02` itself says these are "calibration targets … not a proof".
- **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS. Required: a power study over (NT, K, n_biased, δ, class balance, a, b) with ≥ 200 replicates per cell, reporting sensitivity and specificity with confidence intervals.

### 5.4 Reputation (Level C) and anti-collusion

#### REPUTATION-001 — Author score
- **Claim.** `C_a = (α₀ + Σ w_j q_j)/(α₀ + β₀ + Σ w_j)`, `w_j = exp(−Δt_j/T)`, `(α₀, β₀, T) = (2, 3, 18 mo)`.
- **Evidence.** `reputation::author_score`; `level_c.rs` reproduces the docs' 4/7 and 182/205 examples and monotone decay.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED. Note `q_j ∈ [0,1]` "a function of the Level B statistics" is never defined; every test uses `q ∈ {0, 1}`.

#### REPUTATION-002 — Evaluator BSS reproduces the oracle
- **Evidence.** `level_c.rs::evaluator_bss_reproduces_the_oracle` to 1e-6 (5 profiles).
- **Evidence status.** TESTED — of a function the evaluator score no longer uses: since T50 (D33) the score is the leave-one-out difference score; `brier_skill_score` is kept as the sim oracle.

#### REPUTATION-003 — "Following the consensus scores ≈ 0"
- **Claim (docs/02 §C.2, docs/01 D6).** BSS is normalized against the crowd baseline `p̄_j`; someone who replicates the consensus gets `BSS ≈ 0`.
- **Analysis.** The sim and `reputation::base_rate_baseline` normalize against the **outcome base rate `mean(o)`** — a constant known only after outcomes, not the crowd's declared probabilities. Under this baseline the "follows the peer average" profile scores **−1.33**, not ≈ 0, and the "always predicts the base rate" profile scores exactly 0. The documented property refers to a baseline that is not implemented; the implemented property ("guessing the base rate scores 0") is different and depends on hindsight.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED (T31). Chose (a) the crowd-prediction baseline `p̄_j = Σ_u w_u p_uj / Σ w_u` (D23), matching D6's incentive argument: `reputation::crowd_baseline`, and the protocol's E_u (`honeypot::reviewer_skills`) normalizes BSS against it. `level_c.rs::at_rep_02_a_consensus_follower_scores_zero` (AT-REP-02) pins `BSS = 0` for a follower. The zero-denominator guard is separately RESOLVED (AT-REP-03, §0-ter). Residual: the sim's `levelc_bss` reference still uses the base rate — it reproduces the BSS *function*, not the E_u policy. **Superseded by D33 (T50):** the baseline is the leave-one-out mean of the *other* panelists (`reputation::loo_baseline`) and the score its difference form; a reviewer who reports the others' mean scores exactly 0 on every item and weighs exactly 1 (AT-REP-02 re-pinned on `loo_scores`).

#### REPUTATION-004 — Reputation dynamics (was: temporal asymmetry)
- **Claim (D34, T51).** The weight reads the symmetric mean of the per-item scores; a one-sided CUSUM on the per-item scores against the reviewer's own mean, `s ← max(0, s + (S_u − S_uj) − k)`, alarm at `s > h` (`k = 0.03`, `h = 1.5`, provisional), returns the reviewer to probation.
- **Evidence.** `reputation::{Cusum, CusumParams}`, `probation::SkillTrack` (runs the detector only out of probation; an alarm restarts the mean, the count and the statistic). `change_detector.rs` (AT-REP-07): a seeded honest stream of 10,000 items (the paper's `panel_bias` regime) raises at most one alarm; a reviewer who starts flipping 20% of forecasts after 300 honest items is caught within 100 items on nine of ten seeds (median 25, the paper's 36; the tenth after 356 — the drift at `k = 0.03` is about 0.01 per item, so detection is noise-driven and the tail is long), is back on probation (weight 0) and established again after 30 honest outcomes. `level_c.rs`: alternating ±0.3 scores never alarm, a drop of 0.1 alarms at item 22. `adversarial.rs::a_long_con_is_unprofitable` reworked on the detector: a sustained drop of 0.1 below the reviewer's own mean trips the CUSUM within 22 items.
- **Analysis (history).** `asymmetric_ema` with caller-supplied `(up, down)` penalized variance, not error: its stationary level sat far below the true mean (paper §5.5). Removed in T51.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (D34, 2026-09-25); `k`, `h` provisional (T25); the game-theoretic incentive claim (AT-REP-01) is still a HYPOTHESIS.

#### REPUTATION-005 — Weight cap `w_max = 3·median(w)`
- **Analysis (history).** With `E_u ∈ (0,1)` and `w_u = min(w_max, E_u)`: if `median(E) ≥ 1/3` then `w_max ≥ 1 > E_u` and the cap never binds. The tests bound it only with synthetic weights of 2.0 and 5.0, which `evaluator_score` could not produce.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED (D33, T50). The weight is `exp(γ·S_u·k_u/(k_u+k₀))` — unbounded above — and the cap is `3 × median` over the reviewers who carry weight (`orchestrator::epoch_weight_cap`): a reviewer reliably 0.1 better than a crowd of nine weighs 16 uncapped and 3 capped (`evaluator_score.rs`, `orchestrator_driver.rs`, AT-REP-04). G-12 closed.

#### REPUTATION-006 — Probation
- **Evidence.** `probation::{status, review_weight}`; tests. Weight is not consumed (BRIDGE-007).
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED, NOT WIRED.

#### REPUTATION-007 — Appeal stake is coherent with the score model
- **Claim.** The appeal's cost is a pseudo-observation `q = 0` inside `C_a` (`docs/02` §C.1, D27): escrowed at filing (age 0), replaced by the item's real `q_j` on promotion, left standing on failure; an author files only while `C_a ≥ α₀/(α₀+β₀)`.
- **Evidence.** `appeal::{AuthorHistory, appeal_floor, STAKE_QUALITY}`, `orchestrator::settle_appeal` (T61). `appeal_stake.rs`: filing moves a fresh author from 0.4 to 1/3 at once; a failed appeal leaves the zero and refuses the next filing until a good item restores the average; promotion replaces the zero (2.9/6 > 0.4); `run_item` returns `AppealWindowClosed` / `InsufficientReputation` from the verdicts; the terminal state settles the escrow. `end_to_end.rs`: the author's reputation is higher after the successful appeal of the true-but-divisive item than without it.
- **Analysis (history).** The retired `gate::settle_appeal(reputation, stake, promoted, gain)` added/subtracted constants from a posterior mean of item qualities: not expressible as any set of `(q_j, Δt_j)`, and no escrow during the pilot. Removed in T61.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED, WIRED (D27 as decided, 2026-09-25). The floor and the stake's age weight are provisional (T25).

#### COLLUSION-001 — Identical-vector cartel is discounted to √k
- **Claim.** 400 or 500 nodes with identical judgment vectors form one cluster at `|ρ| ≥ 0.99` and their summed discounted weight is `√k` (unit weights).
- **Evidence.** `anti_collusion.rs` (500 vs 22), `scoring/tests/adversarial.rs` (400 vs 120).
- **Evidence status.** TESTED for the identical-vector, dense, unit-weight case only.

#### COLLUSION-002 — Noisy coordination is detected
- **Failure condition.** A cartel that adds small independent noise to a shared pattern escapes clustering.
- **Auditor probe (Python, m = 24 as in `adversarial.rs`, pattern ~ U(0,1)).** Jitter σ = 0.02: 99.8 % of pairs ≥ 0.99. σ = 0.05: **0.2 %** of pairs ≥ 0.99 → no clustering → no discount. σ = 0.10: 0 %.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED (D39, T56). The statistic is the correlation of model residuals over the shared items, flagged at `ρ ≥ 0.7` with a permutation p-value ≤ 0.001 (`collusion::coordination_clusters`). `coordination.rs::at_col_07_…` (AT-COL-02/07): the paper's cartel of 10 with jitter σ = 0.05 among 190 honest reviewers in two camps — all 45 cartel pairs flagged (residual correlation +0.89), none of the 18,000 honest pairs (+0.015 same camp, +0.018 cross camp); the false-positive rate against like-minded honest reviewers is zero on this dataset, and the threshold 0.7 rather than 0.5 is what keeps it so (four honest pairs reach 0.5 by chance). The probe's raw-correlation rule chains the whole majority camp into one cluster on the same data.

#### COLLUSION-003 — Sparse judgment matrices
- **Analysis.** `correlation_matrix` requires dense rows (`Vec<Vec<f64>>`, equal length, no missing marker). In the design each item has `k = 7–11` reviewers drawn at random; a reviewer with `n_min = 30` reviews shares with another reviewer, in expectation, `n₁n₂/M` items — 0.81 for M = 100, 0.08 for M = 1000. Pearson correlation is undefined or meaningless at that overlap. The docs' alternative ("distance in `f_u`") is not implemented.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED (D39, T56) for the design's regime by construction: `collusion::ResidualHistory` keeps residuals sparsely, per reviewer and item, across epochs; a pair is read only on the items both rated and only from `MIN_SHARED_ITEMS = 30` of them (`coordination.rs::the_history_accumulates_across_epochs`: a coordinated pair becomes readable, and is flagged, once its shared items reach 30 over the epochs; `a_pair_below_the_shared_floor_is_never_flagged`). The dense `correlation_matrix` stays as the retired rule's reference. The design-scale simulation (M = 500, 9 ratings per reviewer, AT-COL-03) is still open.

#### COLLUSION-004 — The discount never increases a weight
- **Analysis.** `discount_weights` maps a cluster with total `s` to per-node `w_i · s^α / s`. For `s < 1` this is an **increase**: a singleton with `E_u = 0.25` becomes 0.50; 0.5 → 0.707 (auditor-computed). `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the tests only state the `w = 1` case.
- **Evidence status.** INV-14 VIOLATED. Fix: `w_i · min(1, s^{α−1})` or apply the transform to counts rather than to `E_u`-scaled weights; specify which.

#### COLLUSION-005 — Connected-component chaining and griefing
- **Analysis.** Union–find over `|ρ| ≥ thr` is transitive: one honest node correlated ≥ thr with one cartel member joins the cartel cluster and is discounted with it. `|ρ|` also merges *anti*-correlated nodes. Because judgment histories must be public for reproducibility (PRIV-004), an adversary with a few real identities can target an honest reviewer's history to pull it into a cluster. Random assignment slows but does not prevent this over time.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED (D39/D40, T56). Clusters use average linkage over the flagged pairs (a merge needs the mean residual correlation over *all* cross pairs to reach `ρ_min`), and only positive residual correlation counts, so a single pair chains nobody and opposite camps are never joined (`coordination.rs`: every honest reviewer a singleton). Griefing (AT-COL-05): an attacker who copies an honest reviewer's ratings forms a pair with them and nothing more (`a_mimic_forms_a_pair_with_its_target_and_chains_nobody_else`), and under D40 the pair costs the honest reviewer no weight — only their mimic is never seated with them (T57).

### 5.5 Identity

#### ID-001 — Cross-source duplicate enrollment is rejected
- **Claim.** Two enrollments with the same canonical anchor produce the same label and the second is refused.
- **Preconditions.** Same oracle key; `normalize_cf` (trim + uppercase) maps both documents to the same `Anchor`.
- **Assumptions.** The anchor is correct and authenticated (nothing in code authenticates it: `Cie { codice_fiscale: String }` is a bare string).
- **Evidence.** `identity/tests/properties.rs`, `threshold_oprf.rs`, `protocol/tests/{end_to_end,adversarial}.rs`.
- **Evidence status.** TESTED for the registry logic. **Uniqueness of persons is NOT ESTABLISHED** — see ID-004, ID-005, docs/03 F2 (foreign passports live in a different anchor space).

#### ID-002 — Obliviousness of the label computation
- **Claim (docs/03 M1).** No issuer learns the anchor.
- **Analysis.** `VoprfOracle::label` runs RFC 9497 blind/evaluate/finalize correctly (library `voprf` 0.5.0, Ristretto255-SHA512, `new_from_seed` = DeriveKeyPair with info `isegoria/uniqueness/v1`), but the method signature hands the cleartext anchor to the object that owns the server key. `ThresholdOprfOracle::label_with_quorum` likewise. No client/server message types exist.
- **Evidence status.** The primitive is IMPLEMENTED and TESTED (`voprf_oracle.rs` asserts blind-independence, key separation, wrong-key rejection on the raw API). The **architectural** property is NOT IMPLEMENTED: the `UniquenessOracle` trait MUST be split into `blind(anchor) → (BlindedElement, ClientState)`, `evaluate(BlindedElement) → Evaluation` (server side, no anchor), `finalize(ClientState, Evaluation) → Label`.

#### ID-003 — Threshold: `t−1` members cannot compute the label
- **Claim.** In `oprf::ThresholdOprfOracle`, any `t` verified partials Lagrange-combine to `k·B`; fewer than `t` yield no information about `k`.
- **Assumptions.** Trusted dealer honest and forgets the polynomial; shares distributed to distinct parties; DDH/one-more-DH on Ristretto255; DLEQ challenge domain-separated (`isegoria/oprf/dleq-challenge/v1`, six points compressed).
- **Evidence.** Unit tests in `oprf.rs`: subset agreement (3 quorums), sub-threshold refusal, 2-of-5 interpolation ≠ correct label, lying member caught by DLEQ, key separation.
- **Findings.** (i) The whole committee — all `KeyShare`s — lives in one struct in one process; the security property is modelled, not provided. (ii) `lagrange_at_zero` with duplicate indices in `quorum` divides by zero; `curve25519-dalek` `Scalar::invert` of zero returns zero silently → a wrong label with no error; `label_with_quorum` MUST reject duplicate indices. (iii) `UniquenessOracle::label` always uses the first `t` members; no liveness/fault handling.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (functional). Security: standard construction (2HashDH threshold OPRF with Chaum–Pedersen proofs), **INDEPENDENTLY_REVIEWED: NO**; deployment property NOT ESTABLISHED (no DKG, no transport).

#### ID-004 — The OPRF input is bound to the state-authenticated anchor
- **Claim needed by the design.** The blinded element the committee evaluates is a blinding of `H(cf)` for the *same* `cf` the identity source authenticated.
- **Analysis.** In the obliviousness-preserving flow, the holder blinds. Nothing prevents a holder from blinding an arbitrary string, obtaining a label for a fake anchor, and enrolling any number of times. Binding requires, e.g., the IdP to sign `H(cf)` (or a commitment) and the holder to prove in ZK that the blinded element opens to the signed value — or the IdP to perform the blinding, which then gives the IdP the unblinding key. None of this is specified or implemented; the current code sidesteps it only because the *registry* calls the oracle with the cleartext anchor (ID-002).
- **Evidence status.** **NOT ESTABLISHED. This is a design gap, not an implementation gap** (§14 G-02).

#### ID-005 — Label authenticity and registry custody
- **Claim needed by the design.** The label submitted for dedup is the genuine OPRF output, and whoever holds the registry cannot use it to deanonymize.
- **Analysis.** `docs/03` M1 says "no issuer learns the label" and, two lines later, "uniqueness is verified by checking the label is not already in the set (or the user proves its freshness in ZK)". `credential.rs` signs the label as a BBS+ message, so the issuer *does* learn it. Whoever holds both the registry and ≥ t OPRF shares can enumerate the ~10⁸ codice-fiscale space, compute all labels, and read the registry as a list of enrolled persons. A holder who computes its own label can submit a fabricated one unless the issuer re-derives or verifies it.
- **Evidence status.** CONTRADICTORY in docs; NOT IMPLEMENTED beyond an in-memory `HashSet`. The specification MUST state who holds the registry, what the issuer verifies about the label, and whether the label is ever revealed at presentation (it MUST NOT be, or issuer-side unlinkability fails — PRIV-002).

#### ID-006 — Key lifecycle
- **Analysis.** Labels are `F(k, anchor)`. Rotating `k` (compromise, member churn, proactive refresh — `oprf.rs` lists "proactive share refresh" as future work, which does *not* change `k`; a *re-keying* would) changes every label and silently re-opens double enrollment. Issuer-key rotation invalidates all credentials; re-issuance must preserve the holder's `x` or all nullifiers change (whitewashing by design). Neither lifecycle is specified.
- **Evidence status.** NOT ESTABLISHED (INV-11).

#### ID-007 — Non-rotatable pseudonyms / no whitewashing
- **Claim.** A person cannot obtain a second pseudonym for the same role.
- **Evidence.** `derive_nym` and `nullifier::prove` are deterministic in `(x, role)`; `protocol/tests/adversarial.rs::whitewashing_cannot_shed_a_bad_reputation`.
- **Analysis.** The test shows the *same secret* yields the same nym and the *same anchor* is refused a second enrollment. It does not, and cannot, show that a person cannot obtain a second credential with a *different* secret: the issuer never checks the registry, never checks that a label has not already been issued a credential (`Issuer::issue` signs any label with a valid PoK, any number of times), and the label→credential step is unlinked from `EnrollmentRegistry`. Two credentials for one label = two nyms per role.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T11 for the in-process form (was NOT ESTABLISHED). `credential::IssuanceRegistry` + `Issuer::issue_once` enforce **one credential per label**: a second request for a label already issued is refused with `IssuanceError::AlreadyIssued`, whatever secret it carries — so a person (one label from enrollment) gets one credential, one set of role nyms. Tests: `id007_one_credential.rs` (AT-ID-02, AT-ID-03). Residual: the cryptographic-grade enrollment that binds the label to the request without a trusted registry (ID-004/ID-005) is T20.

#### ID-008 — Rate limiting
- **Claim (docs/03).** One token per slot; reuse reveals the key; the holder proves in ZK that `slot < quota`.
- **Analysis.** `rln_token = H(secret, role, epoch, slot)` is a hash. A verifier cannot check which slot it encodes, that `slot < quota`, or that it derives from a valid secret; `within_quota` checks a *claimed* integer. Reuse yields a duplicate hash (detected) but reveals nothing. The documented Shamir-based RLN (two evaluations of a degree-1 polynomial reveal the secret) is not implemented.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T11 for the structural in-process form (was NOT ENFORCED). `admission::QuotaLedger` counts proposals per **verified Propose nullifier id** (INV-9) for the epoch and `deposit_with_identity` refuses one over `quota` with `DepositRejected::OverQuota`; the quota is set from the author score `C_a` via `reputation::proposal_rate` (reputation, not money — invariant #3). Tests: `id008_proposal_quota.rs`. Residual: the cryptographic-grade RLN (a ZK proof that `slot < quota` from a valid secret, with reuse revealing the key) is T20 — the in-process ledger trusts the verifier to key on the proven id, which T6 provides.

### 5.6 Cryptography

#### CRYPTO-001 — Single-server VOPRF
- **Primitive.** RFC 9497 VOPRF mode, `Ristretto255-SHA512`; library `voprf` 0.5.0 (`Cargo.lock`); key derivation `VoprfServer::new_from_seed(seed, info)`; blind randomness `rand_core::OsRng`.
- **Evidence.** `voprf_oracle.rs`.
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED. Library security assumed (not audited here). Not wire-compatible with `oprf::ThresholdOprfOracle`; two label spaces coexist.

#### CRYPTO-002 — Threshold OPRF — see ID-003.

#### CRYPTO-003 — BBS+ blind issuance
- **Primitive.** BBS+ over BLS12-381 (`bbs_plus` 0.25.0, `SignatureG1`, params `SignatureParamsG1::new::<Sha256>(b"isegoria/bbs+/v1", 2)`), Pedersen commitment `C = h₀·r + h₁·x`, Schnorr PoK (`schnorr_pok` 0.23.0) with Fiat–Shamir over `(bases, C, t, label)` via `compute_random_oracle_challenge::<Fr, Sha256>`; `new_with_committed_messages` with the label as uncommitted message index 1.
- **Evidence.** `bbs_credential.rs`, unit tests in `credential.rs` (commitment hides bytes of the secret — a weak test; fresh blinding per request; tampered label or swapped commitment rejected).
- **Findings.** The issuer signs any valid request any number of times (no per-label issuance record). The PoK transcript omits a context/domain string beyond the label; a request is replayable to the same issuer (harmless only because the resulting credentials are for the same `x`). `Credential::from_secret` accepts any 32 bytes; `x = 0` gives `N = O` for every role (holder's own loss, but the verifier does not reject the identity point).
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (functional). Unforgeability/blindness rest on the library's proofs (q-SDH, DL). INDEPENDENTLY_REVIEWED: NO.

#### CRYPTO-004 — Threshold BBS+ issuance
- **Primitive.** `bbs_plus::threshold` (DKLS18/19 OT-based multiplication, `oblivious_transfer_protocols` 0.12.0, `secret_sharing_and_dkg` 0.16.0), `KAPPA = 256`, `STAT = 80`, base-OT key size 128; trusted-dealer Shamir via `deal_random_secret`; base OT bootstrapped in-process from a `StdRng` seeded with the same seed as the key (`credential.rs:340`).
- **Findings.** All shares, all base-OT material, and the dealer seed are in one struct. The base-OT randomness is derived from the *same* seed as the signing key; in a real deployment these MUST be independent. `threshold_sign` always uses members `1..=t`. Signing runs the full MPC per issuance (cost not characterized).
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED (3 functional tests). Security property (no `t−1` coalition signs) is that of the library's protocol and is *modelled* here. INDEPENDENTLY_REVIEWED: NO.

#### CRYPTO-005 — Nullifier is bound to a valid credential
- **Construction.** `N = x·H_role`, `H_role = hash-to-G1(role tag)` with DST `isegoria/nullifier/hash-to-g1/v1` (WB map, `DefaultFieldHasher<Sha256>`); `PoKOfSignatureG1Protocol` with message 0 blinded by a chosen `ρ` (`MessageOrBlinding::BlindMessageWithConcreteBlinding`), message 1 (label) blinded randomly; commitment `t = ρ·H_role`; single challenge `c = H(BBS+ transcript ‖ H_role ‖ N ‖ t)`; verifier checks the BBS+ proof and `s·H_role = t + c·N` where `s` is the proof's response for message 0.
- **Analysis.** This is the standard AND-composition of two sigma protocols sharing a witness (as in BBS pseudonym constructions). Soundness: an accepting proof with the extracted `x` in the signature and `s = ρ + c x` forces `N = x·H_role`. Zero-knowledge: `ρ` fresh per proof (OsRng). Both messages are hidden (`revealed = BTreeMap::new()`), so the label is **not** revealed at presentation — this is correct and contradicts `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "revealing only the label" description of the future presentation.
- **Evidence.** `nullifier.rs` unit test (swapped nullifier rejected); `identity/tests/nullifier.rs` (verify, determinism, role distinctness, person distinctness, wrong issuer).
- **Evidence status.** IMPLEMENTED, TESTED. **Bespoke composition; INDEPENDENTLY_REVIEWED: NO — external cryptographic review REQUIRED** before any security claim. Not used by the protocol crate (PROTO-007).

#### CRYPTO-006 — Cross-role unlinkability of nullifiers
- **Claim.** Given `(H_p, N_p, H_j, N_j)` with `N_p = x H_p`, `N_j = x H_j`, deciding whether the same `x` is used is hard.
- **Assumption.** DDH in BLS12-381 G1 (the SXDH assumption). In a type-3 pairing there is no efficient map G1→G2, so `e(N_p, H_j) = e(H_p, N_j)` cannot be evaluated with both arguments in G1. The module comment says "(DDH)"; the specification MUST name SXDH explicitly, because DDH is *false* in G1 of a type-1 pairing and a future curve change would break the property silently.
- **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS under a standard assumption; no test can establish it.

#### CRYPTO-007 — Commit–reveal binding
- **Analysis.** `review::commit(prob, nonce) = SHA-256("isegoria/commit/v1" ‖ prob_le ‖ nonce)` binds neither the item nor the committer. If commitments are visible before reveal, reviewer B can copy reviewer A's commitment and, after A reveals, reveal the same `(prob, nonce)` — the classic commitment-copying attack, which reintroduces exactly the herding the mechanism exists to prevent. `prob.to_le_bytes()` also makes `0.0` and `−0.0` distinct commitments and admits NaN.
- **Evidence.** `lifecycle.rs::commit_reveal_binds_the_judgment` (value hiding/binding); `protocol/tests/inv12_commit_binding.rs` (AT-BR-06: a copied commitment does not open under another committer, nor for another item).
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T7 (was a specification defect). `review::commit(prob, nonce, committer, item) = SHA-256("isegoria/commit/v2" ‖ prob_le ‖ nonce ‖ committer ‖ item)`; `reveal` recomputes against the revealer's nym and the item, so a commitment opens only for its committer and item (INV-12). The `lifecycle` `Revealing` state carries the item and the reveal is checked against `(reveal nym, item)`; NaN/out-of-range probabilities are already rejected at reveal (`ProbabilityOutOfRange`). Residual (cosmetic, not security): `prob.to_le_bytes()` still distinguishes `0.0`/`−0.0`. **The committer id is the T6 nullifier id**, so the binding is to the verified nullifier.

#### CRYPTO-008 — Randomness for lottery, assignment, honeypot placement, sortition
- **Analysis.** `lottery::admit(base_seed, epoch)`, `review::assign_reviewers(item_seed)`, `honeypot::inject(seed)`, `governance::stratified_sortition(seed)`, `blueprint::assemble_test(seed)` are deterministic in a caller-supplied `u64`. The tests use constants. No document says where the seed comes from. If it is derivable from data an author controls (e.g. the draft CID, which the author can grind by editing whitespace), the author can select its reviewers — the brigading the random assignment is meant to prevent. If it is chosen by an operator, that operator can select reviewers for any item.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T8 (was NOT ESTABLISHED). `randomness::Beacon::from_checkpoint` takes a consortium-signed `Checkpoint` and derives every draw's seed as `seed(purpose, index) = H(head ‖ height ‖ purpose ‖ index)`, domain-separated per draw. The `_from_beacon` wrappers (`lottery`, `review`, `honeypot`, `governance`) are the sanctioned entry points; the raw `u64`-seeded draws remain for unit tests. Two properties give AT-BR-05: (1) the seed is a function of the signed head, which commits to every deposit and is fixed only once a threshold co-signs — an author cannot influence or predict it before deposits close; (2) reviewer assignment keys `index` on the item's **byte-independent admitted slot**, not the draft CID, so regenerating the draft cannot move the panel. Tests: `inv10_checkpoint_seed.rs`. Residual: the *publisher/timing* of the checkpoint at epoch close is part of the runtime layer (T13–T18); `blueprint::assemble_test` still takes a raw seed (committee-chosen coverage, not an adversarial draw).
- **Reopened (second review, 2026-09-23) → PARTIAL, roadmap T37.** Property (1) holds only against an author who does not control the tail of the log. The head is a deterministic function of the log content, so it is computable by anyone who sees the pending entries before signing: the publisher that orders the last deposits, a threshold of signers choosing which of several candidate heads to sign, or a last depositor who sees the log can try variants and keep the seed they prefer. The beacon must be separated from the state commitment (e.g. a unique threshold signature over the epoch number, drand-style, or commit-reveal among members bound before the deposit window closes).
- **RESOLVED@T37** (D41, specified in `docs/04` §The epoch's beacon and §9.4). `network::beacon::BeaconRound` is the round in process: each member derives one secret per epoch from its key, commits to it bound to its own key, the network, the member set and the epoch, signs the commit (`Member::beacon_commit`); `close_commits` fixes the commit set and returns the record appended to the log before the deposits close; `close_deposits` opens the reveals; a reveal counts only if it opens its member's commitment; `finish` gives the `BeaconOutcome` — the value `H(…/beacon/value/v1, N, M, e, s₀, …, sₙ₋₁)` if `t` members revealed, who revealed, who withheld, and the record appended to the log. `randomness::Beacon::from_outcome` replaces `from_checkpoint`, and `seed(purpose, index) = H(…/beacon/v2 ‖ B ‖ purpose ‖ index)` keeps the purpose tags and the `_from_beacon` wrappers. A withholder's checkpoint signature does not count for the epoch (`Consortium::verify_excluding`). The lottery reads the deposit set in content-id order (PROTO-002). Tests: `beacon_round.rs` (AT-NET-10) and `inv10_beacon_seed.rs` (AT-BR-05): 130 logs that differ after the commit set — 64 variants of the last deposit, each in two orders, one deposit fewer, one more — have 130 heads and one seed; on the previous code 64 variants gave 64 seeds, 21 of which admitted the variant's author (three seats among ten), and the reversed deposit list drew another admitted set on 50 of 50 seeds. Residual (accepted): the last revealer's choice between two values, public (D41, §18).

### 5.7 Privacy

#### PRIV-001 — Role pseudonyms are mutually unlinkable
- For `nullifier`: see CRYPTO-006. For `derive_nym` (SHA-256): unlinkability holds under preimage resistance *only if the secret has ≥ 128 bits of entropy*; nothing enforces how `secret` is generated (`Credential::from_secret` accepts `[9u8; 32]`). **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS (cryptographic); tests only show inequality.

#### PRIV-002 — Issuer-side unlinkability
- **Claim.** The issuing committee cannot link a credential presentation/nullifier to an issuance transcript.
- **Analysis.** Issuance transcript contains `(C, label, PoK)`. Presentation (`nullifier::prove`) hides both messages, so linkability would require breaking BBS+ proof-of-knowledge ZK or DDH. Holds **only if the label is never revealed**; `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes a future presentation "revealing only the label", which would break this claim outright (the issuer saw the label at issuance).
- **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS; the design document contradicts the code on whether the label is revealed. The specification MUST state that the label is never disclosed after issuance.

#### PRIV-003 — Statistical deanonymization mitigations
- `docs/03` mandates text normalization, batched publication with random delay, no precise timestamps, domain quotas by lottery, structured citations. **None is implemented**; `Draft` holds free bytes; `log::Entry` has no timestamp (good) but no mixing either. **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS / NOT IMPLEMENTED.

#### PRIV-004 — Reproducibility vs. secrecy of voting patterns
- **Analysis.** `docs/04` and `docs/CLAUDE.md`: "do not put voting patterns … on a public register in the clear". `docs/04` and INV-7: "anyone can re-run the computation". Re-running `bridging::fit` requires the full `(u, j, r)` matrix, i.e. every judge-nym's every rating, and the output includes `f_u` — a political-position estimate per pseudonym. `governance::stratified_sortition` and `review::assign_reviewers` consume `f_u` per nym. These requirements are in direct tension. Options: (a) restrict re-running to consortium members and light-node *sampling* (weakens "anyone"); (b) succinct proofs of computation (`docs/01` D14 step 4, "mature phase"); (c) publish only aggregates plus a designated-verifier audit. The repository chooses none.
- **Evidence status.** UNRESOLVED DESIGN TENSION (§17 Q-1).

#### PRIV-005 — Small-network anonymity degradation
- `docs/02` §B.6 acknowledges a privacy floor (~2,000 active nodes). No quantitative k-anonymity model exists. **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS.

#### PRIV-006 — Respondents are not profiled across batches
- **Claim.** An operator holding the answer sheets with their `Respond` proofs cannot follow one person's answers from batch to batch, nor read a latent class off them.
- **Analysis.** The respondent nullifier has role scope, not batch scope: `N = x·H_role` with `H_role = context_generator(role)` (`identity::nullifier`), which depends on the role alone, and `NullifierProof::id()` is `H(N)` — the same for one person on every batch and epoch (`nullifier_is_distinct_per_role_and_stable_within_one`); `pilot::submit_response` keys each batch's `NullifierSet` on that id. Whoever receives the sheets with their proofs can therefore join one person's rows across batches. Before D38 the joined rows carried little: an item with DIF was piloted once and discarded. A contested fact (D38, T55) is by construction an item one latent class misses more often at equal ability, and it stays in the bank, administered continuously; a test's score is DTF-balanced, but the pattern of which contested facts a person misses reveals the class — in the civic use case, the camp. `docs/02` §B.7 forbids the *engine* from matching classes across fits through shared respondents for this reason; the operator can do it from the sheets.
- **Evidence status.** NOT ESTABLISHED (A-OPERATOR). No mitigation is chosen: `docs/10` T69 lists the options, one of which touches invariant #5.

### 5.8 Network / storage

#### NET-001 — Content addressing
- `cid::cid(bytes) = SHA-256(tag "isegoria/cid/v1", len-prefixed bytes)`. TESTED (`integrity.rs::cid_binds_to_content`). Note `deposit::Draft::content_id` concatenates `item ‖ primary_source` **without** a length prefix before hashing, so `("ab", "c")` and `("a", "bc")` collide (`Template::variant` does prefix). PROTO-011.

#### NET-002 — Merkle inclusion proofs
- TESTED (`integrity.rs`, `properties.rs::merkle_inclusion_always_verifies`, proptest over arbitrary leaf sets). Leaf/node domain separation prevents leaf-as-node confusion.

#### NET-003 — The Merkle root commits to the leaf list
- **Auditor probe (Python replica of `merkle.rs`).** `root([x, y, z]) == root([x, y, z, z])` → **True**. The duplicate-last-node scheme (Bitcoin's CVE-2012-2459 shape) does not commit to the leaf count: a list and the same list with its last element duplicated share a root. Whether this is exploitable depends on what roots are used for (currently: nothing in the protocol crate uses `merkle_root`); it MUST be fixed before roots are anchored or signed (use RFC 6962 hashing — promote the odd node — or include the count in the root).
- **Evidence status.** DEFECT FOUND.

#### NET-004 — Log tamper-evidence
- **Claim (docs/04).** Altering any past entry breaks the chain visibly.
- **Analysis.** `TransparencyLog` is a hash chain with **no signatures** (despite "signed append-only logs"). `verify()` recomputes the chain from `[0;32]`; it detects an inconsistent edit (the test edits one payload without recomputing hashes) but **not a consistent suffix rewrite**: replacing entries `i..` and recomputing all subsequent hashes yields a log that `verify()` accepts. Tamper-evidence therefore exists only relative to an *externally held* prior head (a signed checkpoint or an anchor). No consistency proof (old head ⊑ new head) exists; a light client must re-download the suffix to check extension.
- **Evidence.** `log.rs` unit tests; `integrity.rs::append_only_log_is_tamper_evident`; `properties.rs::log_verifies_and_head_advances`; `log_consistency.rs` (AT-NET-01).
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T14 (was TESTED for the inconsistent edit only). `log::checkpoint()` yields the `Checkpoint{height, head}` the consortium signs (`consortium::Member::sign`, a signature over the head that commits the whole prefix), and `log::verify_extends(&prior)` proves the current log consistently extends a checkpoint the verifier trusts — returning `ForkedHistory` for a consistent suffix rewrite of checkpointed history and `Truncated` for a shorter log, which `verify()` alone accepts. The claim now holds *relative to a signed checkpoint the verifier holds*, exactly as NET-004 required. `log_consistency.rs` co-signs the prior head with a `t`-of-`n` consortium.

#### NET-005 — Checkpoint threshold
- `Consortium::verify` refuses a checkpoint whose `member_set_hash` is not the consortium's own, then counts distinct valid ed25519 (`ed25519-dalek` 2.2.0) signatures over the v2 message (`tag "isegoria/checkpoint/v2"`, network id, member-set hash, `height_le`, head; NET-006) and requires `≥ threshold`. TESTED (3-of-5 passes, 2 fails, duplicates ignored, wrong-message signature ignored). **Configuration RESOLVED@T63** (third review, §0-quinquies: `t = 0` verified a checkpoint with no signature, `t > n` never verified, duplicate keys were accepted, and `verify` ignored the member set — only `CheckpointClient` compared it): `Consortium::new` panics unless `1 ≤ t ≤ n` with distinct keys, as `ThresholdOprfOracle::new` (operator configuration, `docs/12` §2.2), and `t` real members signing a checkpoint that declares another member set fail `verify` (`consortium_config.rs`, AT-NET-09: every `t` in `1..=n` for `n ≤ 5` verifies with exactly `t` signers; `checkpoint_model.rs` unchanged).

#### NET-006 — Checkpoint replay, equivocation, network binding
- **Analysis.** The signed message has no network/consortium identifier and no epoch/time: a checkpoint is valid forever and, after a fork (`docs/04` "freedom to fork" — the same keys may sign on both sides), on both forks. Two threshold-signed checkpoints with the same `height` and different `head` are both accepted; no equivocation detection, no client-side monotonic-height rule, no accountability record. Member set changes (add/remove/rotate keys) are not representable.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T15 (was NOT IMPLEMENTED). `Checkpoint` now carries `network_id` and `member_set_hash` **inside the signed message** (`…/checkpoint/v2`), and `consortium::CheckpointClient` is the §9.4 client state machine: it rejects a foreign `network_id` (AT-NET-05) or member set, ignores a non-monotonic `height` as a replay (`Stale`, AT-NET-03), and on two threshold-signed checkpoints at the same height with different heads returns `Forked{trusted, conflicting}` — the equivocation evidence (AT-NET-04). Tests: `checkpoint_replay.rs`. Higher-height fork: **RESOLVED@T38** for a client holding the log — `CheckpointClient::ingest_with_log` accepts a higher checkpoint only if its log consistently extends both the trusted and the new head (`log::verify_extends`), returning `Forked` for a threshold-signed checkpoint on a different history, `LogBehind` while the log has not caught up, and `LocalLogDiverged` if the local copy left the trusted history (`checkpoint_fork.rs`). The checkpoint-only `ingest` still cannot tell and is documented as such. **Model-tested (T43)**, both entry points, against an independent §9.4 model (`checkpoint_model.rs`). It found one misreport, now fixed: a local log shorter than the *trusted* checkpoint was `LocalLogDiverged` (the local copy at fault) although nothing showed it had left the trusted history. After trusting a checkpoint without the log, or on first use, an honest prefix got that verdict. It is now `LogBehind`; `LocalLogDiverged` needs a log long enough to show another head at the trusted height, or a broken chain (`checkpoint_fork.rs::a_local_log_behind_the_trusted_checkpoint_is_behind_not_diverged`). Residual: member-set *rotation* in the checkpoint is future (CS-4/T22).

#### NET-007 — Erasure coding
- `reed-solomon-erasure` 6.0.0, GF(2⁸), systematic. TESTED (any-k recovery via proptest; below-k fails). **Shard authentication RESOLVED@T16:** `Encoded` carries a per-shard `manifest` (`erasure::shard_hash`), and `erasure::reconstruct_verified` authenticates every present shard against it, dropping a wrong shard as lost before decoding — so a corrupted shard cannot silently corrupt the output; if fewer than `data_shards` authentic shards remain it returns `TooFewAuthenticShards` (`shard_authentication.rs`, AT-NET-06). **Layout validation RESOLVED@T44:** the shard counts and `orig_len` arrive with the shards, and are now checked before anything is sized from them (`RecoverError::InvalidLayout`) — an overflowing count panicked inside the library and a huge `orig_len` was allocated (`docs/12-panic-audit.md` F5–F6). No placement, repair, or churn model yet. **Evidence status.** Coding primitive + corrupted-shard detection TESTED; placement/repair/churn UNSOLVED.

#### NET-008 — Anchoring verification
- `opentimestamps` 0.2.0 parses `.ots`, recomputing each step's output by executing ops from `start_digest` (auditor checked `timestamp.rs::deserialize_step_recurse`), and `OtsAnchor::walk` compares a `Bitcoin{height}` attestation's digest to the injected block root. Sound given a trustworthy block source. TESTED (lifecycle, mismatch, garbage). **Note** `verify` is the only entry that parses untrusted bytes. **Hostile bytes RESOLVED@T44** (was: "the recursion limit in the library bounds it, but a fuzz test is absent"): the recursion limit bounds depth only. On hostile bytes the library panics on an overlong varint (debug builds), allocates whatever length an unknown attestation declares (a process abort), and doubles the message at each `Hexlify` with no cap (`docs/12-panic-audit.md` F1–F4). `anchoring::within_bounds` now walks the same grammar first, executing nothing, and refuses a proof beyond the bounds (depth 256, operation results ≤ 4096 bytes as in python-opentimestamps, declared lengths inside the proof, ≤ 1 MiB materialized, ≤ 64 KiB proof); genuine proofs pass (`tests/fixtures/ots/`). Fuzz target `network/fuzz/ots_verify`; stable properties in `hostile_input.rs` (AT-NET-07).

#### NET-009 — Anchoring liveness and linkage
- No calendar submission, no Bitcoin block source, no scheduler ("hourly"), and nothing anchors a consortium checkpoint head (the only caller of `submit` is a test). **Evidence status.** NOT IMPLEMENTED beyond the proof format.

#### NET-010 — Transport, replication, convergence
- Gossip, DHT, CRDT: not implemented; no type in the workspace represents a peer, a message, or a replica. `docs/07` §17's convergence invariant cannot be stated for code that does not exist. **Evidence status.** HYPOTHESIS.

### 5.9 Protocol

#### PROTO-001 — Deposit requires a primary source — TESTED (`lifecycle.rs`). The source is a byte string; "primary source" is not validated (no structured citation type, contrary to `docs/03`).

#### PROTO-002 — Lottery — TESTED (deterministic per `(seed, epoch)`, bounded, no duplicates; proptest). A function of the *set* of deposits (T37): `admit` sorts them by content id and drops a repeat before drawing, so the order the log lists them in — the publisher's choice — cannot move the draw (`inv10_beacon_seed.rs`). Seed provenance: CRYPTO-008. Equal expected access holds only if the deposited set is not Sybil-inflated (ID-007) and rate limits hold (ID-008).

#### PROTO-003 — Stratified reviewer assignment — TESTED (9 of 200, one per stratum, deterministic). Requires `f_u` per candidate. **New-reviewer path (T39):** a reviewer below `n_min` has the position the fit projects for it on the axis it does not define (`Ratings::axis`; the origin with no ratings yet) and is a candidate like any other — drawn into panels (`reviewer_floor.rs`), at weight 0 until it is established (D36) — so it fills the space without defining it. Limit: a newcomer-heavy population crowds the central strata; a separate draw for newcomers is an option for T25/Phase 3. **Open (T72):** the stable sort on `f_u` keeps tied reviewers — every newcomer at the origin — in the order the caller lists them, and that order picks the panel: the same candidates reversed drew another panel of 9 on 100 of 100 seeds (probe on `cae4954`, 20 newcomers among 50); ties must break on a canonical key, as the lottery reads its deposits in content-id order since T37.

#### PROTO-004 — Gate and appeal — TESTED (four outcomes; appeal recovers item 03 in e2e). `appeal_threshold = 0.5` on `|f_j|` appears only in a test constant; not in `docs/02`'s parameter table.

#### PROTO-005 — Pilot stage semantics — Stage 1 = `r_pbis ≥ 0.20 ∧ a ≥ 0.6`; Stage 2 = `|β₂| ≤ 0.40` on a supplied `group`. No `|b| ≤ 2.5`, no `c`, no MH, no mixture in the pilot; the mixture appears only in re-validation. Sample sizes (300/1500/3000) are not parameters of any function. TESTED on synthetic and fixture data.

#### PROTO-006 — Batch enforcement — RESOLVED@T9 (was NOT ENFORCED).
- The DIF stages run through batch-admission gates that refuse a batch below `K_MIN` items (INV-8) and a sample below its §B.6 floor: `pilot::admit_dif_batch`, the wrappers `pilot::{screen, dif_batch}` (Variant 1) and `revalidation::revalidate_batch_latent` (production Variant 2), with floors `N1_MIN`=300 / `N2_MIN`=1500 / `N_LATENT_MIN`=3000, and — the latent re-check — a third floor on the anchors: KR-20 ≥ `KR20_MIN` = 0.90 on the batch's respondents (`pilot::admit_anchors`, D37, T53). `end_to_end.rs::run_epoch` runs the pilot through the gates, and `lifecycle::step` independently rejects `Pilot2Batch { batch_size < K_MIN }` (T12). AT-PRO-02 passes (`inv8_batch_min.rs`).

#### PROTO-007 — Pseudonym validity is verified by the protocol
- **Analysis.** `review::Reviewer.nym`, `probation::FounderSet`, and reputation maps are keyed on `nym::Nym` = SHA-256 of a secret, presented without proof. Anyone can mint unlimited `Nym`s. Sybil resistance, non-rotatability, and rate limiting are therefore properties of the *identity crate in isolation*, not of the protocol as wired. `lib.rs` of `identity` lists "unifying the protocol pseudonym with the ZK nullifier" as future work.
- **Evidence status.** RESOLVED@T6 (was NOT IMPLEMENTED). `protocol::admission::admit` verifies a role `NullifierProof` (via `nullifier::verify`) and returns `NullifierProof::id()` — a domain-separated hash of the verified nullifier `N = x·H_role`; the entry points `deposit_with_identity` (context = draft cid) and `review::submit_review` (context = item cid + epoch) require it, and `review::NullifierSet` keys per-item dedup on that id, not on `derive_nym`. A bare `Nym` carries no proof and cannot act (`AT-PRO-01`); a proof is bound to its action context and cannot be replayed (`AT-ID-05`); tests in `protocol/tests/inv9_nym_proof.rs`. **Remaining for a full Sybil claim:** the cryptographic-grade enrollment/replay hardening and per-credential quota are T20/T11, and the bespoke nullifier composition is still externally UNREVIEWED (§7.4).

#### PROTO-008 — Supplementary review — RESOLVED@T10/T30, extra round @T60 (was NOT SPECIFIED). `lifecycle`: `SupplementaryReview` holds the extra round (`Event::AssignExtraReviewers`, `Commit`, `CloseCommits`, `Reveal`; `Event::Resolve` only on a complete round, else `NoExtraPanel`/`PartialEpoch`); `orchestrator::{extra_round, expanded_ratings, run_item}` fold the extra reveals into the ratings before `gate::supplementary_review` (re-run bridging over the first panel plus the extra one, decide `S_j` vs τ); `supplementary_redecision.rs`, `orchestrator_driver.rs`, the model suites.

#### PROTO-009 — Honeypot
- `inject` and `reviewer_skill` TESTED. Not specified: how golden items' "known quality" is established without a Level-B run (a committee opinion — which is the thing Level A is not supposed to trust), how committee members are prevented from reviewing their own golden items, and how the base-rate baseline (REPUTATION-003) interacts with a deliberately balanced golden set.

#### PROTO-010 — Governance — `stratified_sortition` TESTED; `change_approved` = 2/3 ∧ ≥ 30 days. The sortition draws from candidates carrying `f_u`, i.e. judge nyms; how a drawn judge nym then *acts* (produces golden items, sets blueprints) without linking to its propose nym is unspecified (PRIV-004).

#### PROTO-011 — Draft serialization — DEFECT (NET-001 note): `Draft::content_id` MUST length-prefix its fields.

## 6. Mathematical specification (normative) and audit

Each subsection gives: the model as it MUST be implemented, its parameter constraints, identifiability conditions, numerical failure modes, finite-sample limitations, the implementation's conformance, and what empirical characterization is still required. "Mathematically correct" is asserted nowhere; conformance to a stated equation is.

### 6.1 Bridging factorization

**Model.** For observed set `Ω ⊆ [n]×[m]`, `r_uj ∈ [0,1]`:
```
r̂_uj = μ + b_u + b_j + f_u·f_j            (d = 1; the code implements only d = 1)
L(θ) = Σ_{(u,j)∈Ω} (r_uj − r̂_uj)² + λ_b(Σ_u b_u² + Σ_j b_j²) + λ_f(Σ_u f_u² + Σ_j f_j²)
B_j  = min_{s ∈ {full} ∪ {1..m_boot}} b_j^{(s)}
```
**Parameters.** `λ_b = 0.15`, `λ_f = 0.03`, `m_boot = 10`, `keep = 0.85`, `τ ≈ 0.08`, `ε ≈ 0.008`. MUST satisfy `λ_b > λ_f > 0`. `τ`, `ε` MUST be recalibrated per deployment (docs/02 §A.3); no calibration procedure exists.

**Identifiability.** (i) Sign of `f`: `(f_u, f_j) → (−f_u, −f_j)` leaves `L` invariant; the code does not fix the sign (tests take `|corr|`). Any consumer of `f_u`'s sign across epochs (stratified assignment, sortition, `appeal_threshold` on `|f_j|` is sign-free) MUST canonicalize the sign (e.g. fix the sign of a designated reference item). (ii) `μ` vs `b`: `μ` is unregularized, `b` regularized → identifiable. (iii) Scale of `f_u` vs `f_j`: fixed only through `λ_f` symmetric penalty. (iv) Connectivity: if the bipartite graph `Ω` is disconnected, components have independent `(μ+b)` offsets and `f` signs — the engine does not check connectivity; assignment with `k = 7–11` per item and random draws makes disconnection unlikely but not impossible at small `m`.

**Numerical failure modes.** Non-convex (bilinear); L-BFGS finds a stationary point dependent on the seeded init; the warm-started bootstrap intentionally correlates the subsample solutions with the full solution (this suppresses optimizer noise *and* sampling variability — the pessimistic min therefore underestimates true bootstrap spread; not characterized). No convergence status (OPT-001). `random_init` uses Box–Muller with `ln`/`cos` (platform libm).

**Finite-sample.** Tested at `n = 200, m = 10, |Ω| = 1800`. Behaviour at design scale (`n` in the thousands, `m` in the hundreds per epoch, ~9 ratings per node, `k` per item) is not characterized; `n_min = 30` is unimplemented.

**Conformance.** `bridging.rs` conforms to the equations. Deviations from the sim: warm-start, inclusion of the full fit in the min, different subsample RNG (both documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` except the full-fit inclusion).

**Required characterization.** Seed sweep (≥ 100 seeds) at the fixture size; sweeps over split ratio (50/50 → 90/10), rating noise, sparsity, `k`; `d = 1` fit on `d = 2` populations; capture-cost curves with confidence bands; sensitivity of verdicts to `(λ_b, λ_f, τ, ε)`.

### 6.2 L-BFGS (`optim::lbfgs`)

Two-loop recursion, history `m_hist`, initial scaling `γ = sᵀy/yᵀy`, strong-Wolfe line search since T48 (`c₁ = 1e-4`, `c₂ = 0.9`, Nocedal & Wright Alg. 3.5/3.6, safeguarded cubic interpolation; previously Armijo backtracking with halving), curvature pairs kept iff `sᵀy > 1e-12`, stop on `‖g‖_∞ ≤ g_tol` or relative progress `≤ 1e-12(1+|f|)` or `max_iters`. No bounds (the sim's `L-BFGS-B` is called without bounds, so this is equivalent in intent). Unit tests: quadratic, Rosenbrock, numerical-gradient check.
**Defects.** No status (OPT-001). Armijo-only line search does not guarantee the strong-Wolfe curvature condition; the `sᵀy > 1e-12` filter compensates for positive-definiteness but the history can starve (no pairs added) and the method degrades to scaled steepest descent silently.
**Post-audit (T41).** Status now returned (T2). cargo-mutants found that a line search that failed — the step halved 60 times, or `x + step·d` rounded back to `x` so Armijo passed with `f_new == f` — was reported `Converged`, because the relative-progress stall test ran before the failure check; fixed, and the failed trial point is not taken if it raised the cost (`optim::tests::an_uphill_gradient_is_a_failed_line_search_not_convergence`). Efficiency, measured against SciPy L-BFGS-B (`m = 10`): a condition-10⁴ quadratic in 20-D takes ~515 gradients (SciPy ~790), but Rosenbrock from `(−1.2, 1)` took ~670 (SciPy ~46) with the Armijo-only search; with the strong-Wolfe search of T48 it takes ~51. The stall criterion can declare convergence with `‖g‖_∞` far above `g_tol` when `f` is near 0 (3·10⁻⁵ vs 10⁻⁹ on that quadratic).

### 6.3 Logistic regression (`glm::fit_logistic`)

Unpenalized MLE via `lbfgs`, `g_tol = 1e-8`, `max_iters` 200 (2PL) / 400 (DIF). Stable `sigmoid`/`softplus`. **Failure mode:** complete or quasi-complete separation → unbounded MLE; returned coefficients are whatever the iteration cap leaves. Any verdict computed from such a fit is undefined. The specification MUST either (a) add a weak ridge penalty (e.g. `1e-4·‖w‖²`) and document it, or (b) detect separation and mark the item "undetermined".

### 6.4 IRT

**Ability.** `θ_i = (T_i − mean T)/sd_pop(T)`, `T_i = Σ_anchor X_ia`; `θ ≡ 0` when `sd = 0` (T36). Not an IRT ability; downstream thresholds are in this proxy's metric (IRT-001).
**2PL per item.** `logit P(X_ij = 1 | θ_i) = w₁ θ_i + w₀`; `a_j = w₁`, `b_j = −w₀/w₁` (NaN/∞ when `w₁ = 0`). Retention: `a_j ≥ A_MIN = 0.6`. `B_ABS_MAX = 2.5` is defined and never applied.
**Point-biserial.** Pearson between the 0/1 item and `total` (caller passes `θ`, a linear transform of the anchor total ⇒ identical correlation). Retention `≥ 0.20`; negative ⇒ inverted key. The spec's "total score on the rest of the test" is not what is computed (anchor total is used).
**Not implemented.** 3PL (`c_j`), infit/outfit MNSQ, `|b| ≤ 2.5`.
**Required.** Either estimate items on an IRT-scaled `θ` (e.g. EAP under the anchors' 2PL) or re-derive `A_MIN` for the proxy metric by simulation; add 3PL or justify its absence for the item types admitted (multiple choice with ≥ 4 options is exactly where guessing matters; item 02 already fails because of it).

### 6.5 DIF Variant 1

`logit P = β₀ + β₁θ + β₂g + β₃θg`, `g ∈ ℝ` (spec: continuous `f_i`; fixtures: `±1`). Reject if `|β₂| > 0.40`. No SE, no LRT, no Bonferroni/FDR across a batch. MH on `g > 0` with equal-frequency θ strata (`n_strata` caller-chosen; 5 in tests), `Δ_MH = −2.35 ln α_MH`, classes at 1.0/1.5 without significance. Purification: flag → recompute θ on anchors ∪ clean batch → repeat to a flagged-set fixed point (≤ `max_rounds`).
**Admissible input.** NONE under INV-1/INV-4 (DIF-002).

### 6.6 DIF Variant 2 (latent-class mixture)

```
P(X_ij = 1 | θ_i, z_i) = σ( a_j (θ_i − b_j − δ_j z_i) ),   z_i ∈ {−1,+1},  P(z=+1) = π
ℓ(π, a, b, δ) = Σ_i log[ (1−π)·Π_j P(x_ij | z=−1) + π·Π_j P(x_ij | z=+1) ]
LR = 2(ℓ_full − ℓ_null(δ≡0)),   BIC_gain = LR − K·ln(NT)   (> 0 ⇒ two classes)
DIF_j (spec) = |b_j^{+} − b_j^{−}| = 2|δ_j|;  code reports 2|δ_j| and rejects at 1.0 (T35, provisional)
```
Init: `a = 1, b = 0, δ ~ 0.3·N(0,1)` (seeded), `logit π = 0`. Optimizer: `lbfgs` with central differences `h = 1e-5`, `g_tol = 1e-6`, ≤ 3000 iters.
**Identifiability.** Label switching `(δ, π) ↔ (−δ, 1−π)` resolved by `|δ|`. Under the null, `π` is unidentified and the LR statistic is not χ²_K (boundary + non-identifiability: Self–Liang / mixture-LRT irregularity); BIC comparison is a heuristic, not a calibrated test. `θ` is fixed at the anchor proxy, so measurement error in `θ` is absorbed into `a`, `b`, `δ` (not characterized).
**Numerical.** Numerical gradient on an NLL of magnitude ~`NT·K·ln 2` has cancellation error ~`ε_mach·f/h ≈ 3e-7` per component at `NT = 3000, K = 8`, comparable to `g_tol`; convergence is effectively decided by the progress criterion. Cost scales as `O(NT·K²)` per gradient (DIF-009).
**Regime tested.** NT = 3000, K = 8, balanced classes, `δ = 0.9`, uniform DIF only, one axis. Nothing else.
**Required.** ~~Analytic gradient; `G ∈ {2,3,4}` with a documented selection rule; non-uniform DIF (`a_j` shift)~~ — done in T40 (see DIF-004). Still required: FP rate at `n_biased = 0`; power surfaces over `(NT, K, n_biased, δ, π)`; a threshold for the discrimination gap; two simultaneous axes; θ misspecification.

### 6.7 Reputation

`C_a` as in REPUTATION-001. *Since T50 (D33):* `S_uj = (p̄_{−u,j} − o_j)² − (p_uj − o_j)²` with `p̄_{−u,j}` the weighted mean of the other panelists' forecasts; `S_u` its mean over `k_u` scored items; `w_u = min(3·median, exp(γ·S_u·k_u/(k_u+k₀)))`, `γ = 35`, `k₀ = 100` (provisional). *Audit snapshot:* BSS `1 − Σ(p−o)²/Σ(p̄−o)²` with `p̄ = mean(o)` (REPUTATION-003), `E_u = σ(γ·BSS)`, `γ` unspecified (tests used 2.0). *Since T51 (D34):* a one-sided CUSUM on the per-item scores against `S_u`, `s ← max(0, s + (S_u − S_uj) − k)`, alarm at `s > h` (`k = 0.03`, `h = 1.5`, provisional) → probation. *Audit snapshot:* EMA `E ← E + r·(new − E)`, `r = up` if `new ≥ E` else `down`; `(up, down)` unspecified; removed in T51. Cap `3·median(w)` (REPUTATION-005). Dasgupta–Ghosh: binary agreement minus baseline, per pair; no aggregation over pairs/items specified. Bayesian Truth Serum: not implemented.
**Required.** Specify the definition of `q_j` and an incentive analysis (`γ`, `k₀`, the CUSUM `k`/`h` and the leave-one-out crowd baseline are specified since T50/T51, provisionally until T25) (at least: is honest reporting a best response under the base-rate baseline when the reviewer knows the batch's approximate base rate?).

### 6.8 Anti-collusion

`ρ_uv` = Pearson over dense rows (undefined rows → 0); clusters = connected components of `{|ρ| ≥ thr}`; `W(G) = (Σ_{u∈G} w_u)^α`, `α = 0.5`, split pro-rata. Defects: COLLUSION-002…005. **Required.** A definition on sparse data (e.g. shared-item rank correlation with a minimum overlap and a permutation null), a clustering rule with a stated FP rate for honest like-minded reviewers, the fix for INV-14, and — above all — a consumer (BRIDGE-007).

### 6.9 Blueprint apportionment and sortition

Hamilton largest-remainder apportionment (deterministic, ties by index); proptest checks sum and ±1 of exact share. Stratified sortition: equal-frequency strata on `f_u`, seats spread by `⌊seats·(s+1)/S⌋ − ⌊seats·s/S⌋`, deficit filled uniformly. Both conform to their doc comments. Neither has a stated randomness source (CRYPTO-008).

### 6.10 Equations in the repository with no implementation

Logarithmic score (`docs/02` C.2); 3PL; infit/outfit; `d = 2` (descoped, D31/T39); `w = min(w_max, E_u)` *as consumed by bridging*; BTS; the throughput and availability tables of `docs/02` §B.6 and `docs/04` (the erasure availability numbers 0.973/0.998/0.983/~1.000 are quoted without a derivation or a churn model).

### 7.2 Threat model per primitive

| Primitive | Adversary | Trust assumptions | Key management | Replay | Revocation | Metadata leakage | Side channels |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VOPRF / threshold OPRF | malicious committee members `< t`; malicious client | dealer honest (until DKG exists); `t` honest online; DDH/OM-DH | seed in memory; no rotation (INV-11) | a blinded element may be re-submitted; harmless (same label) but rate-limits enrollment attempts nowhere | none | committee learns *that* a label was requested and when | scalar mult in `curve25519-dalek` is constant-time; `Scalar::invert` constant-time; the `find` over shares is not (irrelevant) |
| BBS+ issuance | malicious issuer(s) `< t`; malicious holder | q-SDH, DL on BLS12-381; dealer honest; base-OT seed independent (violated in code) | seed-derived; no rotation | request replay → duplicate credential for same `x` (no harm) but **no per-label issuance limit** (ID-007) | none | issuer learns label, timing | arkworks field ops are not guaranteed constant-time; holder-side secret handling unreviewed |
| Nullifier proof | malicious holder (forge/mis-bind); linking adversary (issuer, operators) | SXDH; ROM for FS; BBS+ PoK ZK | holder secret in `Credential` (plain `[u8;32]`, `Clone`, `Debug` prints it) | a proof is not bound to an action/message: **the same proof can be replayed by anyone to attach `N` to a different action**; the proof MUST include the action's CID/epoch in the challenge | none | `N` is a stable identifier per role (by design) | as above |
| Checkpoints | `≥ t` colluding signers; replay | ed25519 EUF-CMA | seed-derived; no rotation/revocation | yes (NET-006) | none | — | — |
| Log | any writer with the head | SHA-256 | — | consistent rewrite (NET-004) | — | payloads are CIDs only; timing not recorded (good) | — |

### 7.3 Reference implementations vs production

Per `README.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md`, the following are **explicitly non-production** and this specification concurs: `ReferenceOracle` (keyed hash, test-only), trusted-dealer keygen for both committees, in-process committees, injected Bitcoin block source, `OtsAnchor::upgrade`. This specification adds to that list: `nym::derive_nym` as the protocol's identifier (must be replaced by the nullifier), `ratelimit::*` (no enforcement), `review::commit` (missing bindings), and all seed constants in tests (no randomness source).

### 7.4 External review required

Before any deployment: (1) the threshold OPRF composition and its DLEQ transcript; (2) the nullifier–BBS+ AND-composition (`nullifier.rs`), including the use of `MessageOrBlinding::BlindMessageWithConcreteBlinding` and `get_resp_for_message`; (3) the threshold BBS+ setup randomness; (4) the whole enrollment protocol once ID-004/ID-005 are specified. Passing tests are not evidence for any of these.

## 8. Privacy model

### 8.1 Adversaries

| Adversary | Observes | Colludes with | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-STATE | that person P enrolled (F1); CF of P | IdP; possibly `< t` committee members; possibly the label registry custodian | link P to any nym or action |
| A-ISSUER | issuance transcripts `(C, label, PoK)`; label registry (if custodian) | `< t` peers | link a nullifier/action to an issuance |
| A-OPERATOR (consortium member, re-runner) | full ratings `(u, j, r)`, answers `(i, j, x)`, all `f_u`, `b_u`, all commitments/reveals, log timing | other operators | link nyms across roles; deanonymize by stylometry/timing/topic |
| A-PARTICIPANT | its own assignments and everything public | other participants (cartel) | identify who wrote/judged an item |

### 8.2 Property statements (each must name its adversary)

| ID | Property | Adversary | Holds if | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRIV-P1 | A-STATE cannot compute label(P) | committee `< t` colluding with the state; OPRF secure | ID-003 deployment + INV-11 | HYPOTHESIS (modelled) |
| PRIV-P2 | A-ISSUER cannot link `N_role` to an issuance | label never revealed after issuance; BBS+ PoK ZK; SXDH | PRIV-002 | HYPOTHESIS (design contradiction in docs) |
| PRIV-P3 | A-OPERATOR cannot link `N_propose` ↔ `N_judge` ↔ `N_respond` cryptographically | SXDH | CRYPTO-006 | HYPOTHESIS |
| PRIV-P4 | A-OPERATOR cannot link roles *statistically* | text normalization, timing mixing, topic quotas, population ≥ floor | PRIV-003 | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| PRIV-P5 | A-PARTICIPANT cannot learn who reviews an item before the verdict | assignment private; commitments unlinkable to nyms until reveal | current `commit` has no nym; the assignment list is a plain `Vec<Reviewer>` with nyms | NOT ESTABLISHED |
| PRIV-P6 | Voting patterns are not on a public register in the clear | — | contradicts INV-7 as designed (PRIV-004) | UNRESOLVED |
| PRIV-P7 | Small-crowd degradation is bounded | population ≥ ~2,000 | no model | HYPOTHESIS |
| PRIV-P8 | A-OPERATOR cannot join one person's answer sheets across batches, so the contested facts they miss do not reveal their latent class (their camp) | A-OPERATOR | a respondent id that does not join batches (a batch-scoped nullifier — invariant #5 to be decided), or sheets never kept with the id (PRIV-004 tension), or a per-epoch rate limit in place of an id — `docs/10` T69 | NOT ESTABLISHED — `NullifierProof::id()` is the same on every batch, and contested facts are administered continuously since D38 (PRIV-006) |

### 8.3 Leakage inventory in the current code

- `Credential` derives `Debug` and prints the secret.
- `EnrollmentRegistry` stores raw labels; `Label` derives `Debug`.
- `review::Reviewer { nym, f_u }` couples a pseudonym with its political-axis estimate in the assignment API.
- `governance::Candidate { id, f_u }` likewise.
- `log::Entry` records `seq` only (no timestamp) — compliant with docs/03's "no precise timestamp in the public log".
- No encryption anywhere: items under review are plaintext `Draft` bytes; the log holds only CIDs, but content distribution is unspecified, so "questions under review stay encrypted until publication" (docs/04) has no implementation.
- `pilot::submit_response` admits a `Respond` proof whose id (`NullifierProof::id()`, `H(x·H_role)`) is the same for one person on every batch and epoch: an operator holding the answer sheets with their proofs joins them across batches, and the contested facts (D38) a person misses profile their latent class (PRIV-006, PRIV-P8, `docs/10` T69).

## 9. Protocol state machines

§9.1 is now a real state machine: `protocol::lifecycle` (T12) owns per-item `State`, and `lifecycle::step`/`deposit` reject every checkable "invalid case" row (`tests/orchestrator.rs`). Preconditions that need primitives from other tasks (identity nullifier T6, RLN quota T11, checkpoint seed T8, commit-copy T7) enter as explicit proof inputs the machine checks. §9.2–9.5 below remain the **specification the code MUST be brought to**. `end_to_end.rs::run_epoch` (the fixture walk) is now routed through `lifecycle::step` (via `orchestrator::run_item`), so the flow no longer lives twice (RESOLVED@T12). The `SupplementaryReview` forward transition is defined via `Event::Resolve`, the D26 re-decision (RESOLVED@T10/T30, PROTO-008).

**Model-tested (T43).** Random walks of `deposit`/`step` agree at every step with an independent reference model of the §9.1 table: the same next state, or the same `Invalid` (`tests/lifecycle_model.rs`). The walks mix the expected event with events that are out of order, from outsiders, repeated, carry copied, lifted or opaque commitments, or carry out-of-range probabilities. They also keep the invariants: no `Score` before every panelist revealed, no double commit or reveal, a distinct panel of odd size in [7, 11], a rejected event changes nothing, `Retired`, a pilot rejection and `Measured` are never left and a gate rejection only by the exploration draw (`Explore` → `Explored`, T52), and `ActivePool` is entered only from `Pilot2` after `Pilot1` — never from an explored item. `orchestrator::{review_round, run_item}` agree with a whole-round model for complete, partial, outsider and double-judge rounds (`tests/orchestrator_model.rs`). The model fixes which `Invalid` is reported when several apply at once (the table does not). The walks also pin a gap, not fixed: if a panelist never commits or never reveals, the round can never be scored and has no other way out of `Revealing`. The reveal-deadline row below (`k_min`, the non-revealer penalty) is still unspecified (G-15); the rule is decided and tracked as roadmap **T58** (replacement, then a quorum of 7 or re-queue, reputation loss and draw suspension for repeated no-shows).

### 9.1 Item lifecycle

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Probation{n<30}` | outcome `o_j` known for a reviewed item | — | `Probation{n+1}` or `Established` at 30 (D36, T50) | the per-item scores `S_uj` accumulate; weight 0 |
| `Founder` | same | declared at bootstrap | `Established` at 30 | weight 1 until then |
| `Established` | epoch close | — | `Established` | `S_u ← mean of the per-item leave-one-out difference scores` (D33, T50); `w = min(3·median, exp(γ·S_u·k_u/(k_u+k₀)))`, the cap over the reviewers who carry weight (binds, REPUTATION-005); each per-item score also feeds the one-sided CUSUM against `S_u` — an alarm restarts the track: `Probation{0}` (D34, T51) |
| any | detected block voting (cluster) | COLLUSION-002/003 fixed | same | `w ← w·s^{α−1}` (INV-14) |

### 9.3 Enrollment and issuance (target protocol; current code is a single in-process call)

| Step | Party | Message | Precondition | Failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Holder ↔ IdP | eID authentication; IdP returns an attestation `A = Sig_IdP(commit(cf))` or blinded equivalent (ID-004 — **design open**) | real document | reject |
| E2 | Holder → committee (`t` members) | `B = r·H₁(cf)` + proof that `B` is consistent with `A` (ID-004) | — | reject |
| E3 | Members → holder | `Z_i = k_i·B` + DLEQ_i | member has share `i` | invalid DLEQ → drop member, need another |
| E4 | Holder | `W = r⁻¹·Σ λ_i Z_i`, `label = H₂(cf, W)` | ≥ `t` valid partials | — |
| E5 | Holder → registry/issuer | `label` + (ID-005 — **design open**: proof of correct derivation or committee-side re-derivation) | label ∉ registry | `DuplicateEnrollment` |
| E6 | Holder → issuer(s) | `(C = commit(x), label, PoK)` | one issuance per label (ID-007) | `InvalidProofOfKnowledge`, `Signing`, `AlreadyIssued` |
| E7 | Issuer(s) → holder | blind BBS+ signature (single or MPC-aggregated) | ≥ `t` members | — |
| E8 | Holder | unblind; verify; derive `N_role = x·H_role` on demand with `nullifier::prove` | — | — |

### 9.4 Consortium checkpoint (target)

| State (light client) | Event | Precondition | Next | Invalid |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Trusted{h, head, member_set}` | receive `cp{h', head', net_id, member_set_hash}` + sigs | `net_id` matches; `member_set_hash` matches; `≥ t` distinct valid sigs; `h' > h`; a consistency proof or the entries `h..h'` show `head'` extends `head` | `Trusted{h', head'}` | `h' ≤ h` (stale — ignore); `h' > h` with a non-extending head (fork — **alarm**, record both) |
| any | two valid cps with same `h'`, different `head'` | — | `Forked` | equivocation evidence published (accountability rule unspecified) |

Implemented@T15: `Checkpoint` carries `network_id`/`member_set_hash` in its signed message and `consortium::CheckpointClient` is this state machine (net/member-set binding, monotonic-height replay rule, same-height equivocation → `Forked`). The consistency-proof arm of the `h' > h` transition (a higher head that does not extend `head`) is provided by `log::verify_extends` (T14) for a client that also holds the log (`ingest_with_log`, T38). Model-tested (T43, `tests/checkpoint_model.rs`), with this table's rows as invariants: the trusted height never decreases; a wrong network, a wrong member set or too few signatures never change the state; two heads at one height are always `Forked`; with the log, `h' > h` is accepted iff the log extends both heads. The first use is trust on first use on both paths: the log is not consulted.

**The beacon round of an epoch** (D41, specified in `docs/04` §The epoch's beacon; T37). One
round per epoch `e` on network `N` with the ordered member set `M` and threshold `t`; the
commit-set record and the outcome are log entries, the deadlines are checkpoints.

| State (round of `e`) | Event | Precondition | Next | Invalid (MUST be rejected) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Committing` | `commit(N, M, e, i, cᵢ, σᵢ)` | `N`, `M`, `e` are the round's; `i` a member; `σᵢ` verifies under `pkᵢ` over `H(…/beacon/commit/v1, N, M, e, cᵢ)`; no earlier commit of `i` | `Committing`, `cᵢ` counted | another network, member set or epoch; not a member; a bad signature; a second commit of `i` |
| `Committing` | commit deadline: the commit set (counted commits in member order) appended to the log and covered by the commit checkpoint, no later than the deposit checkpoint of `e` | a member signs the commit checkpoint only if the record lists its own commit | `Sealed` | a commit after the deadline |
| `Sealed` | the deposit checkpoint of `e` is signed: the epoch's deposits are fixed | — | `Revealing` | a reveal before it |
| `Revealing` | `reveal(i, sᵢ)` | `i` has a counted commit; `H(…/beacon/commitment/v1, N, M, e, pkᵢ, sᵢ) = cᵢ`; no earlier counted reveal of `i` | `Revealing`, `sᵢ` counted | no commit; a secret that does not open `cᵢ`; a second reveal |
| `Revealing` | reveal deadline, `≥ t` counted reveals | — | `Done{B, revealed, withheld}` with `B = H(…/beacon/value/v1, N, M, e, s₀, …, sₙ₋₁)`, one field per member, empty without a counted reveal; the outcome appended to the log; every draw of `e` seeds from `B` | — |
| `Revealing` | reveal deadline, `< t` counted reveals | — | `Failed{revealed, withheld}`: no beacon; the epoch draws nothing and its draws wait for `e + 1` | — |

`withheld` = the members with a counted commit and no counted reveal: recorded with the
outcome, and excluded from the signing set for `e` — the checkpoints that publish the
epoch's draws and results count no signature of theirs. Residual: the last revealer (or `k`
colluding last revealers) chooses among up to `2^k` values while `t` still reveal, and
`n − t + 1` members can stop the beacon; both are public (D41, `docs/04`).

Implemented@T37, in process: `network::beacon` — `BeaconRound` (`open`, `commit`,
`close_commits` → the commit-set record, `close_deposits`, `reveal`, `finish` →
`BeaconOutcome { value, revealed, withheld, record }`), `Member::beacon_commit` (the commit
and the reveal to hold back), `RoundError` for each invalid row, and
`Consortium::verify_excluding` for the epoch's signing set;
`protocol::randomness::Beacon::from_outcome` (none without `t` reveals). Tests:
`network/tests/beacon_round.rs` (AT-NET-10, this table's rows) and
`protocol/tests/inv10_beacon_seed.rs` (AT-BR-05). The deadlines are method calls; binding
them to real checkpoints, and carrying commits and reveals between nodes, is T18.

## 10. Distributed-systems semantics

### 10.1 Append-only log
- **State.** `Vec<Entry{seq, prev, payload: Cid, hash}>`; `head = last.hash` or `0³²`.
- **Append.** `hash = SHA-256(tag, seq_le, prev, payload)`; `seq = len`. Prior entries are never mutated by the API (`tamper_payload` is `#[cfg(test)]`).
- **Verify.** `verify()` recomputes from genesis (inconsistent edits); `verify_extends(&prior)` (T14) detects consistent suffix rewrites (`ForkedHistory`) and truncation (`Truncated`) against a consortium-signed prior head (NET-004 RESOLVED@T14).
- **Required semantics.** `verify_extends(old_head, old_len) → bool` (consistency); signed heads (per-writer or consortium); a definition of *who* may append (currently anyone holding the `&mut`).

### 10.2 Merkle tree
- Duplicate-last-node construction; inclusion proofs verify; **root does not commit to leaf count** (auditor-verified collision `[x,y,z]` vs `[x,y,z,z]`). Not used by the protocol yet. MUST be replaced (RFC 6962) before roots are anchored.

### 10.3 Checkpoints, replication, convergence
- Replication, gossip, DHT, CRDT: absent. "Writes almost never conflict" (docs/04) is an assumption about workload; the one conflict that matters — two reveals for the same `(nym, item)`, two deposits of the same CID, two checkpoints at one height — has no merge rule anywhere.
- **Required convergence invariant (to be stated when CRDT work starts).** For any two replicas `R₁, R₂` that have received the same set of signed entries in any order, `state(R₁) = state(R₂)`; the state MUST be a function of the *set* of entries, which forces per-writer sequence numbers or a grow-only set with deterministic ordering for scoring input (this also resolves REPRO-002).

### 10.4 Erasure coding
- RS(k, n) on byte shards; systematic. Shard hashing RESOLVED@T16: `Encoded.manifest` holds a per-shard hash and `reconstruct_verified` verifies before decode, so a corrupted (not missing) shard is dropped rather than silently corrupting the output. Still required: a repair/placement policy.

### 10.5 Anchoring
- Format-level only. Required: submit `checkpoint.message()` (not the raw log head) hourly; store receipts in the log; verifier reads Bitcoin headers via SPV; define behaviour when the calendar is unavailable (Pending indefinitely).

### 10.6 Crash recovery, partitions, operator compromise
- No persistent state exists (everything is in-memory `Vec`/`HashMap`), so crash recovery is undefined. Partition behaviour is undefined (no network). Operator compromise: a compromised signer with `< t` allies can only refuse or sign truthfully; with `≥ t` it can sign anything (NET-006); the "reproducible computation unmasks it" defense requires re-runners to have the input (PRIV-004) and a published mapping from checkpoint → engine input hash → outputs, which does not exist.

## 11. Threat model

The adversary wants Isegoria to accept a partisan item, reject a fair one, deanonymize a participant, or rewrite history. The adversary controls some real persons (each with one genuine credential), possibly some committee members below threshold, possibly some consortium members below threshold, and can read everything a re-runner can read. Unless stated, the adversary cannot break SHA-256, ed25519, DDH on Ristretto255, or SXDH/q-SDH on BLS12-381.

Classification vocabulary: PREVENTED (cannot happen given assumptions), DETECTED (happens but is observable), CONTAINED (bounded impact), PARTIALLY MITIGATED, ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK, UNSOLVED. "No trivial exploit found" is never mapped to PREVENTED.

### 11.1 Identity

| Attack | Mechanism in design | Result at this commit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sybil via fake anchors | OPRF input bound to eID | **UNSOLVED** — binding unspecified (ID-004); `Cie{codice_fiscale}` is a free string | none |
| Duplicate enrollment, same person, two sources | canonical anchor → same label | DETECTED in the registry for the *same string*; **UNSOLVED** for foreigners with two anchor spaces (docs/03 F2) and for any holder that can pick its input (ID-004) | `properties.rs` |
| Multiple credentials for one label | issuer checks registry / one-per-label | **UNSOLVED** — issuer signs any label any number of times (ID-007) | none |
| Credential cloning (share the secret) | — | ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK by design: sharing `x` shares one identity; the two users collide on every nullifier and gain nothing | — |
| Credential compromise / theft | revocation | **UNSOLVED** — no revocation; non-rotatability makes the loss permanent | none |
| Credential rotation (whitewashing) | deterministic nym, one credential per person | PARTIALLY MITIGATED: derivation is deterministic (TESTED); one-credential-per-person NOT ESTABLISHED (ID-007) | `adversarial.rs` |
| Issuer compromise `< t` | threshold | CONTAINED in the model; NOT ESTABLISHED in deployment (dealer, in-process) | `oprf.rs` tests |
| Issuer compromise `≥ t` | — | ACCEPTED: can issue unlimited credentials (undetectable — issuance is blind) and brute-force labels (docs/03 M1) | — |
| Registry custodian + `≥ t` OPRF shares | — | **UNSOLVED**: enumerates enrolled persons (ID-005) | — |
| Nullifier proof replay onto another action | proof bound to action | **UNSOLVED** — proof not bound to a message (§7.2) | none |
| Rate-limit evasion | RLN | **UNSOLVED** — tokens unverifiable (ID-008) | none |
| Key rotation re-enables everything above | INV-11 | **UNSOLVED** — lifecycle unspecified (ID-006) | none |

### 11.2 Reputation

| Attack | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Whitewashing | see above | — |
| Long-con (accumulate then spend) | MITIGATED (T50, T51): the change detector on the per-item scores sends a reviewer who starts spending reputation back to probation within tens of scored items (AT-REP-07), the cap binds on the odds scale (AT-REP-04), and the weight is consumed by bridging (T5); the game-theoretic best-response analysis (AT-REP-01) is still absent | `change_detector.rs`, `adversarial.rs` |
| Strategic abstention (review only "easy" items) | random assignment; non-reveal penalty | UNSOLVED — no non-reveal rule; abstention after seeing the item is free |
| Score farming via honeypots | sortition-produced golden items | UNSOLVED — committee members know the golden set (PROTO-009) |
| Majority following | leave-one-out difference score (D33) | MITIGATED (T50): a reviewer who reports the others' mean scores exactly 0 and weighs exactly 1 (AT-REP-02); on the fixture the followers score below the expert |
| Deliberate contrarianism | strictly proper scoring rule | CONTAINED: the difference score is strictly proper (AT-REP-05) — a contrarian who is wrong loses; a contrarian who is right gains (by design); the retired ratio-form BSS was not proper (paper Prop. 12) |
| Cartel scoring (agree on predictions to farm the score) | anti-collusion | UNSOLVED — the score is per reviewer against outcomes; coordination does not change it but does change bridging (below) |

### 11.3 Bridging

| Attack | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ideological cartel pushing a partisan item (own camp only) | PREVENTED in the tested regime: 40 own-camp boosters leave `b_j < τ` | `level_a.rs`, sim (auditor re-run) |
| Bipartisan corruption | CONTAINED: needs ≈ 55–70 of 80 of the opposing camp on the fixture (BRIDGE-005) — a cost, not a prevention; scales unknown | sim |
| Strategic ratings by a coordinated block with jitter | **UNSOLVED** (COLLUSION-002); and the discount has no effect on `b_j` anyway (BRIDGE-007) | auditor probe |
| Sparse-data manipulation (target items with few reviewers) | `k` fixed per item; `n_min` implemented (T39: a reviewer below 30 reviews is placed on the axis and moves neither `f_j` nor `b_j`) | PARTLY CONTAINED — a sleeper's few extreme ratings cannot manufacture a position; a cartel member landing in a 7-reviewer panel still has 1/7 of the raw input, and the model's robustness to one extreme rating per panel is uncharacterized |
| Faction impersonation (a cartel member pretends to be of the opposite camp on its history, then "bridges" a partisan item) | bridging estimates `f_u` from history | **UNSOLVED / not analysed**: a patient adversary can build a cross-camp `f_u` cheaply (ratings cost nothing) and then supply "cross-cutting approval" on demand; this is the *designed* trust signal and it is manufacturable at the price of `n_min` sincere-looking ratings |
| Rating inflation/compression (everyone rates 1.0) | `b_u` absorbs severity | CONTAINED for individual bias; global compression destroys the signal (not analysed) |
| Seed grinding for reviewer selection | INV-10 | RESOLVED (T8, T37): assignment keys on a byte-independent slot, so draft grinding is blocked, and the seed is the epoch's commit-reveal beacon, which no deposit, order or checkpoint head moves; the last revealer's two-way choice remains, public (D41, CRYPTO-008) |
| Commitment copying | INV-12 | SOLVED (T7): the commitment binds committer + item (CRYPTO-007) |

### 11.4 Psychometrics

| Attack | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Poisoned answer key | `r_pbis < 0` | DETECTED when the item discriminates and the key is fully inverted (`level_b.rs`); partially wrong keys (multiple-choice with two defensible options) not analysed |
| Deliberately ambiguous / non-discriminating item | `r_pbis`, `a` | DETECTED for the tested item; thresholds' FP/FN uncharacterized |
| Sample poisoning (cartel members answer as respondents to steer `θ` or `δ`) | respondents are the "hard to corrupt" resource per docs; anonymity means a cartel of `c` persons controls `c` of `NT` respondents | **UNSOLVED / not analysed**: what fraction `c/NT` of coordinated respondents flips a DIF verdict or masks one? No simulation exists. With NT ≈ 3000 and a mixture detector keyed on class structure, a coordinated block *is* a latent class — it may be detected as DIF or may *create* DIF on clean items. An intermediary needs no cartel: the `Respond` proof is bound to `(batch, epoch)` and not to the sheet, so whoever forwards the sheets can alter the answers (T70) |
| Coordinated answering to inject a fake latent class | as above | UNSOLVED |
| DIF camouflage (bias that is non-uniform, or split across two axes, or below `δ = 0.5`) | mixture at `δ = 0.9` only | UNSOLVED — nothing below 0.9 or non-uniform is tested |
| Latent-axis manipulation (bias aligned with `θ` itself) | DIF conditions on `θ` | ACCEPTED by design (docs/06 L4: a `θ`-correlated bias is "competence") |
| Topic-pool manipulation | blueprint quotas | PARTIALLY MITIGATED (apportionment implemented; the quota-setting committee is the attack surface, sortition unspecified in randomness) |
| Anchor-item contamination | purification | PARTIALLY MITIGATED for Variant 1 (DIF-007); anchors for Variant 2 are assumed clean with no purification loop |

### 11.5 Privacy

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| Timing correlation (deposit/commit/reveal times ↔ enrollment or other roles) | UNSOLVED — no mixing implemented (PRIV-003); the log has no timestamps but transport will |
| Stylometry on drafts | UNSOLVED — no normalization; `Draft.item` is free bytes |
| Topic correlation | UNSOLVED — no per-author domain quota logic |
| Participation intersection (which nyms were active in which epochs) | UNSOLVED — assignment lists and reveals are per nym per epoch; intersection across roles is a statistical linkage channel |
| Small-crowd deanonymization | ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISK per docs/02 §B.6, unquantified |
| Operator + issuer collusion | see ID-005; label must never be revealed (PRIV-002) |
| Re-runner learns every judge's political position | UNRESOLVED design tension (PRIV-004) |
| Respondent profiling across batches (the `Respond` id is the same on every batch; the contested facts a person misses reveal their latent class) | UNSOLVED — opened by D38, which keeps such facts in the bank and administers them continuously (PRIV-006, PRIV-P8, T69) |

### 11.6 Network

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| Replay of an old checkpoint | SOLVED (T15): the client's monotonic-height rule ignores it (`Stale`); cross-network replay rejected by `network_id` binding |
| Equivocation (two heads at one height, `≥ t` sigs) | UNSOLVED — accepted twice, no detection |
| Fork by consistent suffix rewrite of a log | DETECTED against a consortium-signed prior head (T14, `verify_extends`); a client without a prior checkpoint still cannot judge history in isolation (inherent) |
| Partition | undefined (no network) |
| Stale-state injection to light clients | UNSOLVED — no client state |
| Malicious checkpoint with `≥ t` signers | ACCEPTED (docs: "freedom to fork"); detection via reproducible recomputation NOT IMPLEMENTED (no checkpoint→input→output mapping) |
| Corrupted shard | SOLVED (T16): `reconstruct_verified` drops a shard failing its manifest hash before decoding (NET-007) |
| Gossip poisoning | undefined (no gossip) |
| Merkle leaf duplication | DEFECT (NET-003) — currently unexploitable only because nothing uses the root |
| OTS proof parsing of hostile bytes | SOLVED (T44): a bounded pre-scan refuses the proof before the library parses it (NET-008); fuzzed (`ots_verify`) |

## 12. Adversarial tests (required, keyed to attacks)

Each entry names the test that MUST exist, its oracle, and the claim it falsifies. Tests marked ✓ exist at this commit (with the caveats noted in §5); all others are absent.

| Test ID | Attack / property | Construction | Pass criterion | Falsifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AT-ID-01 | fake-anchor Sybil | holder submits `B = r·H₁(random)` in the target protocol (§9.3 E2) without a valid attestation | rejected | ID-004 |
| AT-ID-02 | double credential | `issuer.issue(req₁); issuer.issue(req₂)` for the same label | second refused (`AlreadyIssued`) | ID-007 |
| AT-ID-03 | whitewashing via new secret | enroll once, request credential with `x₁`, then with `x₂` | second refused | ID-007 |
| AT-ID-04 | duplicate quorum indices | `label_with_quorum(input, &[1,1,2])` | `None`/error, never a label | ID-003 (ii) |
| AT-ID-05 | nullifier proof replay | take `NullifierProof` from action A, attach to action B | verifier rejects (requires message binding) | §7.2 |

| AT-REP-01 | long-con, game-theoretic | agent maximizing Σ_t influence·(betrayal payoff) under the CUSUM `(k, h)`, the odds weight and the cap, with influence actually consumed by bridging | best response is honesty | REPUTATION-004 |
| AT-REP-02 ✓ | consensus follower | `p_uj := p̄_{−u,j}` for all j (the others' mean, D33) | scores exactly 0 on every item and weighs exactly 1 — `level_c.rs`, `evaluator_score.rs` (T50) | REPUTATION-003 |
| AT-REP-03 | denominator zero | all `o_j` equal | finite, defined result | REPUTATION-003 |
| AT-REP-04 ✓ | cap binds | odds weights of nine crowd-level reviewers and one reliably 0.1 better | the outlier weighs 16 uncapped and 3 capped — `evaluator_score.rs`, `orchestrator_driver.rs` (T50) | REPUTATION-005 |
| AT-REP-05 ✓ | properness (D33) | random beliefs and baselines, exact expectation over all outcomes, `m ≤ 4` | the expected score is maximized by the true belief — by exactly `Σ_j (p_j − q_j)²` over any other report (50 instances per `m`, 20 reports each, `evaluator_score.rs`, T50) | REPUTATION-008 |
| AT-REP-06 ✓ | exploration weights (D35) | synthetic reviewers; outcomes observed with probability 1 (passed) or 0.05 (explored rejections) | the weighted score's expectation equals the full-information score within Monte Carlo error; truthful reporting stays optimal — `exploration_weights.rs` (T52): exactly `(b − q)² − (p − q)²` under a report-dependent gate for 2,000 random cases, the bare observed score pays the dissenter to report 0.50; nine reviewers on 100,000 items, the weighted mean within 2.1 standard errors of the full-information mean, the passed-only mean up to 11.6 off | REPUTATION-008 |
| AT-REP-07 ✓ | change detection (D34) | seeded honest stream of 10,000 scored items; a reviewer that starts flipping 20% of forecasts | at most one alarm on the honest stream; the flipper caught within 100 scored items — `change_detector.rs` (T51): the paper's `panel_bias` regime; no alarm in 10,000 honest items; the flipper caught within 100 on nine of ten seeds (median 25, one after 356), back on probation | REPUTATION-004 |
| AT-COL-01 ✓ | identical cartel | 400/500 identical rows | Σw = √k | COLLUSION-001 |
| AT-COL-02 ✓ | jittered cartel | the paper's cartel of 10 with jitter σ = 0.05 on 5 target items, among two honest camps | every cartel pair flagged on residuals and no honest pair — `coordination.rs` (T56); the √k discount is analysis only (D40) | COLLUSION-002 |
| AT-COL-03 | sparse cartel | design regime: M = 500 items, 9 ratings/node, cartel votes identically *on shared items only* | detected | COLLUSION-003 |
| AT-COL-04 | sub-unit boost | singleton `w = 0.25` | discounted weight ≤ 0.25 | INV-14 |
| AT-COL-05 ✓ | griefing | attacker mimics honest node H's history to pull H into a cluster | H's weight unchanged (D40) and the effect bounded: a pair {H, mimic}, nobody else chained — `coordination.rs` (T56) | COLLUSION-005 |
| AT-COL-06 | influence, not weight | cartel of 400 vs 120 honest, weights *consumed by bridging* | `b_j` of a targeted item moves less than with 22 independents | BRIDGE-007 |
| AT-COL-07 ✓ | like-minded honest reviewers (D39) | two camps, long histories, a jittered cross-camp cartel | residual-correlation detector flags the cartel and no honest pair; pairs with fewer than 30 shared items are never flagged — `coordination.rs` (T56): 45 of 45 cartel pairs, 0 of 18,000 honest pairs, the cartel one cluster, every honest reviewer a singleton; the raw rule chains the majority camp | COLLUSION-002/006 |
| AT-BR-01 ✓ | own-camp boost | 40 own-camp boosters | `S_j < τ` (T49; was `b_j < τ`) | BRIDGE-003 |
| AT-BR-02 | crossing curve | boosters 0..80 in steps of 5, ≥ 50 random selections each | crossing distribution reported with CI; docs updated | BRIDGE-005 |
| AT-BR-03 | permutation invariance | shuffle `obs` | bit-equal after canonicalization; `\|Δb_j\| < 1e-9` without | REPRO-002 |
| AT-BR-04 ✓ | cross-platform determinism | the golden bits (`golden.rs`) on linux-gnu (dev and release), linux-musl, macOS-aarch64 and Windows-MSVC — CI job `golden`, every push | bit-equal on all five configurations — linux-gnu dev, release and linux-musl verified locally on 2026-09-25, macOS-aarch64 and Windows-MSVC by the CI job the same day (run 38 on master, `c6ac1fa`) (`scoring::fmath`, the pure-Rust `libm`; on the platform libm the same golden bits moved in 96 of 118 values between glibc and musl); the CI job fails on any divergence on the five configurations | REPRO-001 |
| AT-BR-05 ✓ | seed grinding | author regenerates draft whitespace 1000× to select a panel; the last depositor varies its deposit and the log's order after the commit set is fixed | panel independent of draft bytes; one seed for every log tail — `inv10_beacon_seed.rs` (T8, T37): 130 logs with 130 heads (64 variants of the last deposit in two orders, one deposit fewer, one more) share one seed, and the lottery draws the same vector from a set in any order, with a repeat, over 50 epochs | CRYPTO-008 |
| AT-BR-06 | commitment copying | B copies A's commitment, reveals A's opening after A | B's reveal rejected | CRYPTO-007 |

| AT-BR-08 ✓ | camp-size neutrality (D32) | mirror-image partisan items (same quality, opposite lean), camps 60/40 and 80/20, 200–3,200 reviewers; the review's dataset at 50/50–95/5 in both orientations | leak ≤ 0.1 where the intercept leaks 0.5–0.9; neither mirror item passes at any ratio; a residual leak of 0.1–0.2 with 50–100 reviewers (`side_balanced.rs`, T49) | BRIDGE-009 |
| AT-BR-09 ✓ | decoy stuffing (D32) | add ten weak items (approval ≈ 0.3, no lean) to a batch; the six consensus items alone | no other item's score moves by more than 0.02 and no verdict changes; alone, within 0.02; the intercept moves by more than 0.1 (`side_balanced.rs`, T49) | BRIDGE-008 |
| AT-BR-10 ✓ | co-assignment of a flagged cluster (D40) | randomized assignment draws with a flagged cluster of 50 among 1,000 reviewers, panels of 9 | no panel ever holds two members of the cluster; honest weights unchanged — `panel_diversification.rs` (T57): 2,000 seeds, at most one member per panel and per first-plus-extra round, every panel spans the axis, the uniform draw seats two or more on 6.6% of panels (paper 7.0%); `bridging_weights` takes no cluster input | COLLUSION-006 |

| AT-PRO-07 ✓ | exploration (D35) | 5% of gate rejections drawn from the beacon and piloted | draw reproducible from the beacon and not choosable; an explored item never reaches `ActivePool` — `exploration.rs` (T52): the same beacon and slot always draw alike, 4.8% and 5.1% of 20,000 slots under two beacons with 0.27% in common (re-derived with the commit-reveal beacon, T37; 5.0%, 4.9% and 0.24% on the checkpoint seed), a participant's seed refused; `Measured` on every path, the model suites, the fixtures' real-health item measured as a gate false negative with the pool unchanged | REPUTATION-008 |
| AT-PRO-08 ✓ | contested facts (D38) | assemble tests from a pool with contested facts leaning both ways | every assembled test within the DTF tolerance; a DIF item without a verified source rejected — `contested_facts.rs` (T55): 200 seeds × sizes 1–6 on a pool of three fits leaning both ways (one with three classes) and a lone leaner: every draw's bound ≤ `DTF_MAX`, while the unconstrained draw exceeds it on 183–200 of 200 tests per size; the draw succeeds exactly for the sizes brute force can balance (0, 2, 4, 6) and reaches every balanced selection over the beacon's indices; mirror leaners of two fits add up (0.82), re-measured in one fit they cancel (0); `Pilot2Batch`/`Revalidate` send a DIF item to `Contested` only with a verified source, else `Rejected(Dif)`/`Retired(EmergingDif)`; on two batches fitted through the production gate (`calibration`, N = 3,000, 60 anchors) the flagged items are exactly the leaning ones, the unsourced one is rejected, every drawn test's bound ≤ 0.10 and its true DTF ≤ 0.104, and the three facts of the one-sided batch are never drawn (a pair of them: true DTF 0.80); the draw is a function of the pool's content and the seed — the same fits recorded last to first, their members last to first, through a re-measurement that moves facts between fits, and after a retirement that changes a fit's least member draw the same test, in the same order, on 50 seeds and sizes 0–6 (`the_draw_depends_on_the_content_of_the_pool_not_on_its_history`; before the canonical order the first three histories changed the drawn set on up to 43 of 50 seeds) | DIF-011 |

CI MUST run everything except `simulations/` on every push, and `simulations/` + `cross_platform` on a schedule, with results committed to `reports/`.

Test authorship rules (from `docs/07` §11): each property test states *why* the property holds; a test that encodes a limitation (DIF-005) is labelled `documents_limitation` and not counted as a guarantee; tolerances cite the analysis that justifies them.

## 14. Critical gaps and ambiguities

Only gaps supported by evidence in the repository are listed. Each gives: location, the ambiguity, why it matters, the minimum specification that removes it, and the test that validates the fix.

**G-01 — DIF Variant 1 has no anonymity-compatible input.**
*Location.* `docs/02` §B.3 ("uses the Level A latent axis … `f_i`"), `crates/scoring/src/dif.rs::logistic_dif`, `crates/protocol/src/pilot.rs::stage2_dif`, `crates/protocol/src/revalidation.rs::revalidate_pool`, fixtures `levelb_grp.csv`.
*Ambiguity.* `f` is estimated per judge nym; respondents act under an unlinkable respond nym. The docs never say where a respondent's `f_i` comes from.
*Why it matters.* Pilot 2 as implemented (`stage2_dif`) and the "1500 with a group signal" sample size rest on a variable the system cannot possess without breaking P3 or INV-1.
*Minimum spec.* State explicitly: "In production, Level B DIF is Variant 2 only. Variant 1 is permitted only in attributed calibration pilots (`docs/README` step 2). Pilot 2 sample size is the Variant-2 size." Or: specify a linkage-free source of `f_i` (none is known to the auditor).
*Test.* AT-PRO-02 extended: the production pipeline MUST NOT accept a `group` vector; `stage2_dif` MUST be gated behind a `calibration` feature flag.

**G-02 — OPRF input is not bound to the authenticated anchor; label authenticity and registry custody are unspecified.**
*Location.* `docs/03` §M1 (contradictory sentences on who learns the label), `crates/identity/src/enrollment.rs::{UniquenessOracle, EnrollmentRegistry::enroll}`, `oprf.rs::label_with_quorum`.
*Why.* Without binding, Sybil resistance (pillar 1 of `docs/00`) is not provided by the cryptography; without custody rules, the registry is a deanonymization oracle.
*Minimum spec.* §9.3 E1–E5 with a chosen binding mechanism; a statement of who stores labels, who verifies the derivation, and that the label is never disclosed after issuance.
*Test.* AT-ID-01, AT-ID-02, AT-ID-03.

**G-03 — Reputation weights and collusion discounts are not consumed by bridging.**
*Location.* `crates/scoring/src/bridging.rs::fit` (no weights), `ARCHITECTURE.md` §Future work.
*Why.* Every claim of the form "E_u weights the vote", "500 coordinated count as 22", "probation = weight 0" is currently about numbers nobody reads. `README.md` calls the engine "Complete".
*Minimum spec.* Weighted objective `Σ w_u (r_uj − r̂_uj)²` with `w_u = discount(cap(E_u))` recomputed per epoch from the *previous* epoch's outcomes (state the lag), plus the honeypot contribution rule.
*Test.* AT-COL-06.
*Status.* RESOLVED (T5) — `bridging::fit` consumes `Ratings.weights`; AT-COL-06 passes. The per-epoch, previous-epoch-lag recomputation belongs to the real orchestrator (T12).

**G-04 — Protocol accepts unproven pseudonyms and no rate limit is enforced.**
*Location.* `crates/protocol/src/{review,probation}.rs` (`Nym`), `crates/identity/src/{nym,ratelimit}.rs`, `identity/src/lib.rs` ("unifying … future work").
*Minimum spec.* INV-9; every protocol entry point takes `&NullifierProof` and a verifier context; RLN with Shamir-share slashing or a ZK range proof on the slot.
*Test.* AT-PRO-01, AT-ID-05, AT-ID-06.

**G-05 — Randomness source for lottery / assignment / honeypot / sortition.**
*Location.* `lottery.rs`, `review.rs`, `honeypot.rs`, `governance.rs`, `blueprint.rs` (all take a `u64` seed; tests pass constants).
*Minimum spec.* INV-10 with an exact derivation and publisher.
*Test.* AT-BR-05.
*Status.* RESOLVED (T8, T37): the epoch's commit-reveal beacon among the consortium members (D41, §9.4); the draws take it through `randomness::Beacon::from_outcome`.

**G-06 — Commit–reveal binds neither committer nor item.**
*Location.* `review.rs::commit`.
*Minimum spec.* INV-12.
*Test.* AT-BR-06.

**G-07 — θ metric and IRT thresholds.**
*Location.* `irt.rs` (`theta_from_anchors`, `A_MIN`, unused `B_ABS_MAX`), `docs/02` §B.2 table, `end_to_end.rs:175-179` rationale for item 02.
*Ambiguity.* Whether `a ≥ 0.6`, `|b| ≤ 2.5` refer to the IRT metric or the standardized-total metric.
*Minimum spec.* Declare the metric; either re-derive thresholds for it or estimate an IRT-scaled θ. Decide 3PL.
*Test.* AT-DIF-02 extended with a 3PL generator; verdict_agreement.rs.

**G-08 — Mixture DIF cut-off inconsistent (docs 0.5 on b-gap; sim 0.35 on |δ|; code 0.5 on |δ|).**
*Location.* `docs/02` §B.3, `sim/latent_dif_and_capacity.py:63`, `dif.rs::MIXTURE_DIF_MAX`, `revalidation.rs:58`.
*Minimum spec.* One metric, one value, chosen from AT-DIF-01/02.
*Test.* AT-DIF-05.

**G-09 — BSS baseline (crowd `p̄_j` vs outcome base rate).**
*Location.* `docs/02` §C.2, `reputation.rs::base_rate_baseline`, `sim/bridging_irt_dif.py` (`base = out.mean()`), `levelc_bss.csv`.
*Minimum spec.* Choose; if base rate, re-derive the "correct dissenter is rewarded" argument and specify how `E_u` is computed *before* an epoch's outcomes are known (the base rate is hindsight).
*Test.* AT-REP-02, AT-REP-03.
*Status.* RESOLVED (T31) — chose the crowd baseline (D23): `reputation::crowd_baseline`, and the protocol's E_u (`honeypot::reviewer_skills`) normalizes BSS against `p̄_j`; AT-REP-02 passes. The sim's reference `levelc_bss` still uses the base rate (it reproduces the BSS *function*, not the E_u policy).

**G-10 — Oracle precision, acceptance tolerance, and verdict divergence.**
*Location.* `level_a.rs` (tol 0.03), `fixture_drift.rs` (tol 1e-4, ignored), `end_to_end.rs::EXPECTED_POOL`, auditor regeneration (drift ≤ 1e-3).
*Minimum spec.* Record fixture provenance; pin the Python environment in CI; state that verdict agreement is *not* claimed near τ, or tighten the optimizer tolerances on both sides until it can be.
*Test.* AT-PRO-06, verdict_agreement.rs.

**G-11 — "Same input" is undefined; permutation and platform sensitivity untested.**
*Location.* `bridging.rs` (accumulation order), `level_a.rs:152-165` (HashSet order), `reproducibility.rs` (same process).
*Minimum spec.* INV-13; canonical serialization (`obs` sorted by `(u, j)`, `f64` as IEEE-754 LE bits, CSV/CBOR schema versioned).
*Test.* AT-BR-03, AT-BR-04.

**G-12 — `w_max = 3·median` cannot bind on `E_u ∈ (0,1)` when the median ≥ 1/3.**
*Location.* `reputation.rs::{weight_cap, capped_weight}`, tests using 2.0 and 5.0.
*Minimum spec.* Define the weight scale (is `w = E_u`, or `w = E_u / median(E)`?) so the cap is meaningful.
*Test.* AT-REP-04.
*Status.* RESOLVED (D33, T50) — the weight is on the odds scale, `exp(γ·S_u·k_u/(k_u+k₀))`, and the cap binds (AT-REP-04 ✓).

**G-13 — Sub-unit weights are boosted by the discount; sparse data unsupported; jitter evades clustering.**
*Location.* `collusion.rs`.
*Minimum spec.* INV-14; a sparse-aware coordination statistic; a threshold chosen from a FP/FN study.
*Test.* AT-COL-02..05.

**G-14 — Log is unsigned and detects only inconsistent edits; Merkle root does not commit to leaf count; checkpoints lack network id and replay/equivocation handling.**
*Location.* `log.rs`, `merkle.rs`, `consortium.rs`, `docs/04` ("signed append-only logs", "altering one breaks the chain visibly").
*Minimum spec.* §9.4, §10.1–10.2.
*Test.* AT-NET-01..05.

**G-15 — Supplementary review, appeal escrow, non-reveal handling, minimum batch, sample-size gating are unspecified.**
*Location.* `gate.rs` (`SupplementaryReview` label only; `settle_appeal`), `end_to_end.rs:129` ("assumed to pass"), `pilot.rs` (no N or K checks).
*Minimum spec.* §9.1 rows for `SupplementaryReview`, `Revealing` deadline, `Pilot1/2` preconditions.
*Test.* AT-PRO-02, AT-PRO-03.
*Status.* PARTLY RESOLVED — supplementary review: D26, `gate::supplementary_review`, `Event::Resolve` and the extra round in `SupplementaryReview` (T10/T30, amended by T59, extra reviewers T60); appeal escrow: D27, `protocol::appeal` and `orchestrator::settle_appeal` (T61); minimum batch and sample-size gating: `pilot::{screen, dif_batch}` (T9, INV-8). Non-reveal handling remains unspecified (§9.1 `Revealing` deadline row).

**G-16 — Honeypot committee self-dealing and golden-item ground truth.**
*Location.* `honeypot.rs`, `docs/05` §Golden items.
*Minimum spec.* Golden "known quality" MUST come from Level-B history (retired validated items and items that failed Level B), not from committee opinion; committee members MUST be excluded from panels containing their golden items (requires a linkage the design forbids — state the residual risk).
*Test.* AT-PRO-05.

**G-17 — Key lifecycle (OPRF, issuer, consortium) and credential revocation.**
*Location.* nowhere (absent from docs and code).
*Minimum spec.* INV-11; re-issuance preserving `x`; consortium member-set changes in the checkpoint message; a revocation list keyed on nullifiers (with the anonymity cost stated).
*Test.* AT-ID-05 extension; AT-NET-05.

**G-18 — Draft CID concatenation without length prefix.**
*Location.* `deposit.rs::Draft::content_id`.
*Minimum spec.* Length-prefix all fields (as `Template::variant` does).
*Test.* AT-PRO-04.

**G-19 — Sortition candidates carry `f_u`; acting roles link pseudonyms.**
*Location.* `governance.rs::Candidate`, `docs/05` §Meta-level governance.
*Minimum spec.* State under which pseudonym a drawn member acts and accept/mitigate the linkage; or draw from a separate "governance" nym with its own `f` estimate.
*Test.* none automatable; design review.

**G-20 — Reproducibility requires publishing all ratings; docs forbid a public register of voting patterns.**
*Location.* `docs/04`, `docs/CLAUDE.md` "What NOT to do", INV-7.
*Minimum spec.* Choose an option from PRIV-004 and record it in `docs/01` as a decision.
*Test.* none; design decision.

| BRIDGE-008 | gate independent of the batch | paper §3.3, `levelA_relativity.py`; `side_balanced.rs` (AT-BR-09) | RESOLVED (T49) — the gate reads the side-balanced score, which stays within 0.02 in the batch, alone and next to ten decoys | — | — |
| BRIDGE-009 | camp-size neutrality | paper §3.4, `levelA_leak.py`; `side_balanced.rs` (AT-BR-08) | RESOLVED (T49) — leak ≤ 0.1 from 200 reviewers (0.1–0.2 residual at 50–100); the appeal reads the side gap | a floor on the minority side (T25) | — |

## 16. Acceptance criteria (completion gate)

Completion is **not** "all TODOs removed". Isegoria MAY claim completeness only when every critical claim has proportionate evidence, every threat assumption is explicit, every unimplemented production dependency is named, and every residual risk is documented. The gate is split by discipline; each criterion names the minimum evidence level.

### 16.1 Scientific correctness
- SC-1 Every threshold in `docs/02`'s parameter table has: reason, calibration procedure, sensitivity analysis, failure description, versioned location (`docs/07` §13). *Today: none has all five.*
- SC-2 DIF Variant 2 has FP and power tables (AT-DIF-01/02) with CIs, covering unbalanced classes, δ ≥ 0.5, K ∈ {4..16}, NT ∈ {1500, 3000, 6000}; verdict thresholds are chosen from those tables. Status target: SCIENTIFICALLY_CHARACTERIZED.
- SC-3 Bridging: seed and parameter sweeps (BRIDGE-002/003/005) with reported variance; capture-cost curves replace the single "87 %" figure.
- SC-4 The θ metric is declared and thresholds re-derived (G-07); 3PL decision documented.
- SC-5 Sample sizes (STAT-001) derived from SC-2, not from prose.
- SC-6 The mixture metric is unified (G-08); BSS baseline chosen and the incentive argument re-derived (G-09).
- SC-7 Sample-poisoning curves exist (AT-DIF-07).
- SC-8 External psychometric review of §6.4–6.6 by a qualified reviewer, recorded in `reports/`.

### 16.2 Cryptographic security
- CS-1 The enrollment protocol (§9.3) is fully specified including ID-004 binding and ID-005 custody, and implemented with client/server message types (no cleartext anchor crosses to the key holder).
- CS-2 Both committees have a real DKG and transport; the trusted dealer is gone; base-OT randomness independent of keys.
- CS-3 Nullifier proofs bind the action message; one credential per label enforced; duplicate-index guard in `combine`.
- CS-4 Key lifecycle documented (INV-11) and revocation decision recorded.
- CS-5 External cryptographic review of §7.4 items, recorded.
- CS-6 RFC 9497 and BBS+ test vectors pass (differential/).

### 16.3 Privacy
- PV-1 Every PRIV-P property names its adversary and its evidence; PRIV-P6 (G-20) has a recorded decision.
- PV-2 The label is provably never disclosed after issuance (code + docs agree).
- PV-3 Statistical-deanonymization mitigations (PRIV-003) are implemented or explicitly deferred with the population floor stated as a deployment precondition.
- PV-4 No `Debug` derivation prints secrets or labels.

### 16.4 Protocol correctness
- PC-1 A state machine (§9.1) exists in code with rejection of every "invalid case" row; INV-8, INV-9, INV-10, INV-12 enforced.
- PC-2 Supplementary review, appeal escrow, non-reveal, and batch/sample gating specified and tested (G-15).
- PC-3 Weights consumed by bridging (G-03) with the lag rule stated.

### 16.5 Distributed-systems correctness
- DS-1 Log: signatures, consistency proofs, truncation detection (AT-NET-01).
- DS-2 Merkle: leaf-count-committing construction (AT-NET-02).
- DS-3 Checkpoints: network id, member-set hash, client monotonicity, equivocation evidence (AT-NET-03..05).
- DS-4 Erasure: shard authentication (AT-NET-06).
- DS-5 Anchoring: live calendar + SPV block source, or explicitly deferred; checkpoint→anchor linkage.
- DS-6 Transport/CRDT: convergence invariant stated (§10.3) before implementation begins.

### 16.6 Implementation quality
- IQ-1 `lbfgs` and `fit_logistic` return status; separation detected.
- IQ-2 No `partial_cmp().unwrap()` on caller data; NaN policy stated.
- IQ-3 `Draft::content_id` length-prefixed; `discount_weights` monotone; `brier_skill_score` guarded.
- IQ-4 Clippy `-D warnings` and fmt already enforced (CI) — retain.
- IQ-5 Coverage figure ("~97 %") reported with the command that produced it and its date.

### 16.7 Reproducibility
- RP-1 Canonical input serialization (INV-13) and a published `input_hash → outputs` record per checkpoint.
- RP-2 Cross-platform bit-equality (AT-BR-04) or a documented tolerance.
- RP-3 Fixture provenance and pinned regeneration in CI (AT-PRO-06); oracle tolerance justified.
- RP-4 Release-profile reproducibility test (the current test runs in the test profile).

### 16.8 Operational readiness
- OR-1 Deployment preconditions: population floor, committee sizes and `t`, consortium composition rule, anchoring cadence.
- OR-2 Incident procedures: committee member compromise, signer compromise, holder secret loss.
- OR-3 The closed calibration pilot (`docs/README` step 2) executed with declared attributes, and its results used for SC-1.
- OR-4 A clear public statement of what the system does not prove (§18–19).

## 17. Unresolved questions

Each question preserves an ambiguity found in the repository and offers precise alternatives. None is answered here.

- **Q-1 (PRIV-004 / G-20).** Who may re-run the scoring computation? (a) anyone, with full ratings public per nym; (b) consortium members only, with light nodes verifying signatures; (c) anyone, from a zk proof of computation. (a) contradicts `docs/CLAUDE.md`; (b) weakens D16's "anyone redoes the math"; (c) is D14 step 4.
- **Q-2 (G-01).** Is Variant 1 DIF production or calibration-only? If production, name the source of `f_i`.
- **Q-3 (G-02).** Binding mechanism: IdP-signed commitment + ZK opening; IdP-side blinding; or committee-side evaluation on a cleartext anchor (giving up obliviousness against the committee). Each has a different trust table (§3.1).
- **Q-4 (G-09).** BSS baseline: crowd prediction or outcome base rate?
- **Q-5 (G-08).** Mixture DIF metric: `|δ|` or `2|δ|`; value?
- **Q-6 (G-07).** θ metric: standardized total, or IRT EAP? 2PL or 3PL?
- **Q-7 (G-15).** Supplementary review: (a) `k` more reviewers then re-gate at `τ` without band; (b) escalate to the pilot directly; (c) hold until next epoch.
- **Q-8 (REPUTATION-007).** Appeal cost representation: pseudo-observation with escrow, or a separate ledger outside `C_a`?
- **Q-9 (G-16).** Golden-item ground truth: Level-B history only, or committee judgment?
- **Q-10 (G-19).** Under which pseudonym does a sortition member act?
- **Q-11 (G-05).** Randomness: checkpoint-head-derived, VRF from consortium, or external beacon (drand)? **Answered** by D41: commit-reveal among the consortium members now (T37, §9.4), a unique threshold signature over the epoch number after the DKG (T19).
- **Q-12 (ID-006).** Is the OPRF key ever rotated? If compromise forces it, is the network re-enrolled from scratch?
- **Q-13 (G-17).** Revocation: none (accept permanent loss on secret compromise), or a nullifier blacklist (accept the linkability cost)?
- **Q-14 (docs/03 F2).** Foreign anchors: separate label space accepted as a known Sybil channel, or a cross-space dedup mechanism?
- **Q-15 (D15).** Same or distinct bodies for issuing committee and storage consortium?
- **Q-16 (BRIDGE-001).** Is `d = 2` required for the reference use case? The sims never exercise it.
- **Q-17 (docs/README §Status vs README.md §Status).** `docs/README.md` still says "No production code written yet" and "license to be decided"; `README.md` says the engine is complete and the license is EUPL-1.2. Which is authoritative? (Recommendation: delete the stale paragraph.)
- **Q-18 (PRIV-006 / T69).** The scope of the respondent pseudonym, now that contested facts are administered continuously (D38) and the ones a person misses reveal their latent class: (a) a batch-scoped nullifier (Semaphore's external nullifier), giving up invariant #5's single respondent pseudonym; (b) a stable pseudonym whose answer rows are never kept or published joined to it, at the cost of PRIV-004's re-run; (c) an RLN-style per-epoch rate limit with no stable identifier. None chosen (`docs/10` Open problems).

## 18. Residual risks (accepted or currently unmitigated)

| Risk | Nature | Owner decision required |
|---|---|---|
| Issuing committee `≥ t` colludes: unlimited undetectable credentials | structural | accept; mitigate by committee composition (D16-style) — no technical fix in the design |
| Storage consortium `≥ t` colludes: signs any state | structural; docs propose "fork" | accept; define fork procedure and evidence format |
| True-but-divisive false negatives (L1) | structural; appeal mitigates at author cost; exploration measures the gate's false-negative rate on the explored rejections (D35, T52) | accept; quantify survival with and without appeal |
| Pool-level topic bias (L2) | structural; blueprint mitigates | accept; the sortition seeds from the beacon (T37) |
| Beacon bias by withholding (D41) | the last revealer chooses between two values (`k` colluders among `2^k`) while `t` still reveal; `n − t + 1` members can stop the epoch's beacon; both public and recorded | accept until the threshold signature (T19) |
| Elite-consensus blind spot (L3) | structural; Variant 2 mitigates in the tested regime only | accept with the FP/FN caveat |
| Competence construct choice (L4) | philosophical | accept |
| Faction impersonation over time (§11.3) | not analysed | quantify (AT-BR-07) |
| Sample poisoning by coordinated respondents (§11.4) | not analysed | quantify (AT-DIF-07) |
| Respondent profiling across batches through contested facts (PRIV-006) | opened by D38: a respondent id that is the same on every batch, and facts one class misses administered continuously | decide among T69's options (Q-18) |
| Small-population anonymity loss | acknowledged, unquantified | accept with a floor |
| Foreign-anchor double enrollment (F2) | acknowledged | accept or design |
| Permanent identity loss on secret compromise | consequence of non-rotatability | decide (Q-13) |
| Oracle drift across SciPy versions | measurement | accept with pinned env |
| Bespoke crypto compositions unreviewed | until §7.4 | do not deploy before review |

## 19. Claims not established

The following cannot be established from the repository, from simulation, or from code alone. They are listed so that no reader mistakes their absence from the gap list for evidence.

- **Requires real-world pilots.** τ, ε, λ_b/λ_f, k, `A_MIN`, `BETA2_MAX`, mixture cut-off, `N_PROBATION`, `EXPOSURE_LIMIT = 2000`, `HONEYPOT_RATE = 0.05`, the CUSUM `k`/`h`, `γ`, `k₀` — every operational parameter. The ~30 % survival rate. The claim that human review is "almost uncorrelated" with empirical validity (D3) — observed in a simulation whose generator *defines* the two as independent for most items.
- **Requires population scale.** Level-A identifiability at design sparsity; anonymity floor; throughput; Variant-2 DIF at NT ≥ 3000 with real answer distributions (guessing, non-monotone items, speededness).
- **Requires external cryptographic review.** Threshold OPRF composition; nullifier–BBS+ AND-composition; threshold BBS+ setup; the enrollment binding protocol once designed.
- **Requires external psychometric validation.** The latent-class DIF procedure as a bias test (its FP/FN behaviour, its reliance on a single hidden dichotomy, and the anchor-purification assumptions); the use of a standardized-total proxy for θ in place of an IRT ability.
- **Requires institutional trust assumptions.** Committee and consortium composition; eID correctness; the claim that CIE-NFC verification narrows F1; freedom to fork as a deterrent.
- **Cannot be established from code alone.** That a non-convex factorization "recovers the ideological axis" of a real population rather than the dominant axis of rating variance, whatever it is; that `f_u`-stratified panels "mirror all positions" when `f_u` is itself an estimate with unquantified error; that reproducibility deters signer dishonesty when re-runners must hold data the design says must not be public.
