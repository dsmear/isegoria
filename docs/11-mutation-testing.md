# Isegoria — Mutation testing report (T41)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Measure how much of the code the tests actually *verify*, not just execute, and record every mutant that survives with the reason it is acceptable. |
| **Tool** | `cargo-mutants` 26.0.0 (the newest release that builds on the pinned rustc 1.86). |
| **Date** | 2026-09-24, branch `test/t41-mutation-survivors`. |
| **Status** | Every surviving mutant is either killed or justified below (runs 1–3 for T41, run 4 for the T48 optimizer, run 5 for the T40 detector, run 6 for the T55 contested-facts pool, run 7 for its follow-up, run 8 for the T63 consortium, run 9 for the T37 beacon, run 10 for the T72 candidate order). |

## Why this was needed

Line coverage was already ~97% (`cargo llvm-cov`), yet the second review (`docs/10`
P1.5) found defects in files covered at 96–100%. Coverage says a line *ran*; a mutant
survives when the line can be changed — a `<` into `<=`, a `+` into `-`, a function
body into `return 0` — and no test notices. The survivors are a map of the checks the
suite does not make.

## How to run

```sh
cargo install cargo-mutants --version 26.0.0 --locked
# whole workspace
cargo mutants --workspace -j 4
# one file, or selected mutants by name
cargo mutants -p scoring -f crates/scoring/src/optim.rs
cargo mutants -p scoring --re 'optim.rs:97:'
# only the lines a branch changed
git diff master > /tmp/branch.diff && cargo mutants --workspace --in-diff /tmp/branch.diff -j 4
```

`.cargo/mutants.toml` is read automatically. It builds every mutant under the optimized
`mutants` profile (`Cargo.toml`), which runs the `scoring` suite in ~10 s instead of ~47 s
with identical bits (the golden test passes under it); it enables the `calibration`
feature; and it sets a 60 s minimum test timeout, because the automatic timeout is scaled
from a baseline that runs alone and parallel jobs otherwise produced false timeouts.
Each mutant runs the tests of the crate that contains it. It is too slow for every push:
run it after changing decision logic (`--in-diff` for a branch), and before a release.
Output goes to `mutants.out/` (ignored by git).

A diff whose changed `src/` lines are all in `network` or `identity` fails the baseline under
the config (`the package 'network' does not contain this feature: calibration`): run it with
`--no-config --profile mutants --timeout-multiplier 3 --minimum-test-timeout 60` instead.

## Results

| Run | Scope | Mutants | Caught | Timeout¹ | Unviable² | Missed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | whole workspace | 1482 | 876 | 5 | 381 | **220** |
| 2 | the 17 files that had survivors, after the new tests | 1088 | 1008 | 3 | 37 | **40** |
| 3 | the 9 real survivors of run 2, after their tests | 9 | 9 | — | — | **0** |

¹ The mutant made a loop never terminate (union-find `find`, the mixture optimizer):
counted as caught. ² The mutant does not compile.

By crate, run 1: `network` and `identity` had **no** survivors; `protocol` 30;
`scoring` 188 (bridging 60, DIF 62, optimizer 23, reputation 19, …). After run 3 the
32 survivors left are all **equivalent** mutants (next section).

### Defects the survivors exposed

The work was not only adding assertions. Two survivors pointed at real problems:

1. **The bridging oracle tolerance hid fit errors.** With the gradient's data or
   regularization term corrupted, the fit still reported `Converged` and moved `b_j` by
   up to 0.009 — inside the 0.03 tolerance against SciPy, but wider than the gate's
   uncertainty band (`ε = 0.008`), so it could flip an item across `τ`. The gradient is
   now pinned against central differences, and the oracle tolerance is 0.004 (Rust and
   SciPy agree to ~0.002).
2. **A failed line search was reported as `Converged`** (`optim::lbfgs`). Two paths:
   the step halved 60 times barely moved `f` and the relative-progress stall test ran
   before the failure check; and once `x + step·d` rounded back to `x`, Armijo passed
   with `f_new == f` and no movement. Both are now `LineSearchFailed`, and a failed
   trial point that raised the cost is not taken (`docs/08` OPT-001).

Also recorded (not fixed here): the Armijo-only line search needs ~670 gradients on
Rosenbrock where SciPy needs ~46 (T45); Mantel–Haenszel with more strata than
respondents makes α infinite and classes the item C (calibration-only).

### What was added

| Area | Tests |
|---|---|
| Bridging | gradient vs central differences; objective by hand; oracle tolerance 0.004 and `Converged`; bootstrap must lower scores; empty input |
| All fits | `golden.rs` + `fixtures/golden_bits.txt`: every output of `fit`, `bridge_scores`, `mixture_dif` pinned bit-for-bit (kills initialization, RNG-order and optimizer-path mutants). Regenerate on an intended change with `ISEGORIA_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p scoring --test golden` |
| Optimizer | condition-10⁴ quadratic within a SciPy-like budget; Rosenbrock to 1e-6; immediate stop at a stationary point; exact 1-D convergence; Armijo rejects a non-decreasing step; uphill gradient → `LineSearchFailed`; a failed search keeps the better point |
| Level B | hand-computed Mantel–Haenszel (one stratum, group swap, two strata, unequal strata, empty strata, no discordant cells); purification iterations and θ; 2PL `b`; point-biserial by hand; `sigmoid`/`softplus` at ±800 |
| Level C, anti-collusion | `hand_computed.rs`: author decay, weighted crowd baseline, zero weight, even/odd median, Pearson by hand, constant rows, zero-weight cluster |
| Protocol | `exact_outcomes.rs`: seats per stratum, sortition deficit fill, largest-remainder apportionment, zero shares, coverage deviation, exactly-enough items, honeypots inserted, lottery epoch mixing, `K_MIN` batch, `ExposureLimit`, accessors, one reviewer per stratum |

## Surviving mutants — all equivalent

A mutant is *equivalent* when no valid input can tell it from the original. Line
numbers are those of this branch.

| Mutant(s) | Why it is equivalent |
|---|---|
| `dif.rs:264` and `glm.rs:37` `softplus`: `>` → `>=` | At `z = 0` both branches return `ln 2` exactly. |
| `dif.rs:171`, `dif.rs:238` `d[j] * z` → `d[j] / z` | `z ∈ {−1, +1}`, so `d·z = d/z`. |
| `dif.rs:102`, `dif.rs:103` (Mantel–Haenszel) `item > 0.5`, `group > 0.0` → `>=` | Items are 0/1 and groups ±1: neither threshold value occurs. |
| `dif.rs:111` `ns > 0.0` → `>=` | An empty stratum only exists when there are more strata than respondents; then every stratum holds at most one person, which carries no discordant pair, and α is ∞ either way. |
| `dif.rs:119`, `dif.rs:121` ETS class boundaries `<` → `<=` | `Δ = −2.35 ln α` with α a ratio of counts never equals 1.0 or 1.5 exactly. |
| `validation.rs:36`, `revalidation.rs:47` `|β₂| > BETA2_MAX` → `>=`; `glm.rs:76` `max_z > SEPARATION_LOGIT` → `>=` | Equality of a fitted continuous statistic with the threshold has probability zero. |
| `bridging.rs:314` `rng < keep_frac` → `<=` (was 272) | A uniform `f64` draw equal to 0.85 exactly has probability ~2⁻⁵³ per draw. |
| `bridging.rs:328` `bj < b` → `<=` (was 286); `bridging.rs:156` `obj < best` → `<=` in the multi-start | Replacing a minimum by an equal value changes nothing. |
| `optim.rs:110` `sy > 1e-12` → `>=` | Floating equality at a continuous boundary. |
| `bridging.rs:172`, `bridging.rs:174` (`canonical_sign`) `>` → `>=`, `<` → `<=` | A tie between two `|f_j|` or a leading `f_j` of exactly 0 (then every `f` is 0 and negating gives `−0.0`, equal as a number). |
| `optim.rs:193` `i > 0` → `>=` (expansion) | At `i = 0` a value not below the start already fails sufficient decrease. |
| `optim.rs:218`, `optim.rs:219` the bracket-width stop (`hi − lo` → `hi + lo`; `1e-16 ·` → `/`) | The width stop is reached only by a failing search, where `lo` is still the start (`a = 0`): then `hi + lo = hi − lo` and `max(1, 0) = 1`. |
| `optim.rs:230` `dg · (hi − lo)` → `dg / (hi − lo)` | Product and quotient have the same sign. |
| `optim.rs:247` `\|\|` → `&&`, `optim.rs:252` `disc < 0` → `<=`, `==` | Any non-finite bracket end or negative discriminant makes the cubic minimizer NaN, which the final `is_finite` check sends to bisection anyway (a zero discriminant is a measure-zero double root). |
| `collusion.rs:32` `skip(i + 1)` → `skip(i * 1)` | Adds the diagonal pair `(i, i)`; `union(i, i)` is a no-op. |
| `collusion.rs:64` `s > 0.0` → `>=` | At `s = 0` the product is `0 · min(NaN, 1) = 0 · 1 = 0` (`f64::min` ignores NaN): same result. |
| `collusion.rs:81` (×2) `(a[i] − ma)` or `(b[i] − mb)` → `+` in the covariance term | Centring one factor is enough: `Σ(a + ma)(b − mb) = Σ(a − ma)(b − mb) + 2ma·Σ(b − mb)` and `Σ(b − mb) = 0` (same for the other factor). The variance terms, which are not equivalent, are pinned by `hand_computed.rs`. |
| `governance.rs:74` `.max(lo + 1)` → `.max(lo * 1)`; `review.rs:56` same | The guard only matters for an empty stratum, and `strata ≤ seats ≤ n` (resp. `k ≤ n`) rules that out. |
| `governance.rs:85` (`:76` since T72) `count < seats` → `<=` | At equality the fill loop breaks before changing anything. |
| `review.rs:44` `n == 0 \|\| k == 0` → `&&` | Either zero makes `k = min(k, n) = 0`, and the loop draws nothing. |
| `optim.rs:60` `yy > 0` → `>=` (was line 61) | `yy = 0` means `y = 0`, so `sᵀy = 0` and the pair was never stored (`sᵀy > 1e-12`). |
| `optim.rs:85` `gd >= 0` → `<` (second check, after the steepest-descent fallback; was line 86) | The fallback direction is `−g`, whose slope `−‖g‖²` is negative unless `g = 0`, which the gradient test has already stopped on. The fallback itself is unreachable while stored pairs keep the Hessian estimate positive definite. |

## Run 4 — the T48 optimizer and multi-start

T48 replaced the Armijo line search with a strong-Wolfe one and made the bridging fit a
multi-start, so `optim.rs` and `bridging.rs` were re-run: 464 mutants, 28 survivors.
Three were real and are killed: a fit with every weight 0 produced NaN through a 0/0
start value; the sufficient-decrease sign (a flat point that *raises* the cost must be
rejected); and the bisection fallback (a cost that is infinite past a wall). The
bracketing branches of `zoom` were not exercised at all by the reference problems (with
`c₂ = 0.9` the first interpolated point is almost always accepted), so
`optim::tests::trajectories_on_reference_problems_are_pinned` pins the exact number of
evaluations and the final point, bit for bit, on problems built to reach them — a
cliff past the minimum, a steep wall, a failing search — together with Rosenbrock and an
ill-conditioned quadratic. The survivors that remain are in the table above, plus four
**path-only** mutants:

| Mutant(s) | Why it is accepted |
|---|---|
| `optim.rs:193` `i > 0` → `<`, `==` | Drops the "value rose during expansion" test (Nocedal & Wright 3.5). The search then brackets on the slope sign or accepts a Wolfe point further out: a different trajectory to a valid step, and no constructed problem made it differ. |
| `optim.rs:230` `hi − lo` → `hi + lo` (×2: `+`, `/`) | Differs only once the bracket is reversed (`hi < lo`) *and* an interior point is too steep — not reached by any reference problem. |
| `optim.rs:258`, `optim.rs:259` (×2) the interpolation margins | Matter only when the cubic minimizer falls outside the bracket, which cannot happen while the slope changes sign inside it. |

## Run 5 — the T40 latent-class detector

With the faster configuration, `cargo mutants --workspace --in-diff` on the T40 branch:
208 mutants in 10 minutes, 8 survivors. Four were real and are killed: the free-parameter
count behind the BIC (`dif::tests::free_parameters_are_counted_as_specified`); the seed,
which the seed-robustness test could not see being dropped precisely because the verdict
does not depend on it (`latent_classes.rs::the_seed_changes_the_starts_not_the_verdict`);
the staged-search rule (`::larger_mixtures_are_tried_only_while_the_bic_improves`); and
the gap over three or more classes, which needed data where the BIC really selects three
(`::three_well_separated_classes_are_selected_as_three`). The other four are equivalent:

| Mutant(s) | Why it is equivalent |
|---|---|
| `dif.rs:283` `lo > 0` → `>=` | At `lo = 0` both branches give `softplus = ln 2`, `σ = ½`. |
| `dif.rs:410` `fit.0 < f` → `<=`; `dif.rs:420` `b < best` → `<=` | Exact ties of two fitted likelihoods or BICs. |

## Run 6 — the T55 contested-facts pool

`cargo mutants --in-diff` on the T55 diff, file by file with the suites that exercise
each (the `mutants` profile, `calibration` on, `--cargo-test-arg=--test=…`):
`scoring/src/dtf.rs` with `dtf.rs` and `golden.rs`; `protocol/src/revalidation.rs` with
`latent_revalidation.rs`, `anchor_reliability.rs`, `inv8_batch_min.rs` and
`proto013_respondent_gate.rs`; every other changed line of `protocol` with
`contested_facts.rs` (the fitted scenario skipped), the lifecycle and orchestrator suites
and their reference models, `appeal_stake.rs`, `exploration.rs` and `exact_outcomes.rs`.
115 mutants: 101 caught, 9 unviable, 5 missed. Two were real and are killed: `is_empty`
and `contains` of `ContestedPool` were only ever asserted true (the malformed-records test
now checks both answers). One was equivalent and is gone: `dtf.rs` iterated the pairs of
classes as `h in g + 1..`, and `g * 1` only added the pair `(g, g)`, whose DTF is 0; the
loop is now `h in 0..g` — the same unordered pairs, the same bits (the golden rows did not
move) — and the re-run of `dtf.rs` has no survivor (30 mutants, 29 caught, 1 unviable).
The other two are equivalent:

| Mutant(s) | Why it is equivalent |
|---|---|
| `contested.rs:207` `members.len() < n` → `<=` in `candidates` | Also enumerates subsets of `n + 1` facts, which neither the table nor the draw ever reads: both take only subsets of at most `left ≤ n` members. |
| `contested.rs:208` `k + 1` → `k * 1` in `candidates` | Also enumerates sequences that repeat a member; `ClassCurves::dtf` refuses a repeated index, so they are dropped, and the valid subsets come out in the same order. |

## Run 7 — the T55 follow-up: the pool's canonical order

`cargo mutants --in-diff` on the follow-up's diff of `protocol/src/contested.rs` (the
`mutants` profile, `calibration` on, `--cargo-test-arg=--test=contested_facts`, the fitted
scenario skipped): 4 mutants — `record` to `Ok(())`, `remove` to `true` and to `false`,
`canonicalize` to `()` — 4 caught, none missed, none unviable. The last is the one the
follow-up adds, killed by the history test of `contested_facts.rs` (`docs/08` AT-PRO-08):
without the canonical order the same fits recorded last to first draw another test on 46
of 50 seeds (another set on 43).

## Run 8 — T63: the consortium's configuration and member-set check

`cargo mutants --in-diff` on the T63 diff (`network/src/consortium.rs`; `--no-config` with
the config's profile and timeouts, since `network` has no `calibration` feature): 5 mutants
— `member_set_hash` to `[0; 32]` and to `[1; 32]`, `verify` to `true` and to `false`, and
the new member-set comparison `!=` → `==` — 5 caught, none missed, none unviable. The two
checks of `Consortium::new` sit inside `assert!`, whose arguments cargo-mutants does not
mutate; `consortium_config.rs` pins them instead: every bound (`t = 0`, `t = n + 1`, no
members) and a duplicate apart from its twin panic, and every `t` in `1..=n` is accepted.

## Run 9 — T37: the commit-reveal beacon and the lottery's canonical order

`cargo mutants --in-diff` on the T37 diff, in two halves. `network` (`beacon.rs`, the
`consortium.rs` accessors and `verify_excluding`; `--no-config` as in run 8): 53 mutants —
42 caught, 8 unviable (a `Default` for a type that has none: `BeaconCommit`, `Signature`,
`RoundId`, `Cid`, `BeaconRound`, `BeaconOutcome`), 3 missed. The three were real and are killed:
`indices` — the encoding of who revealed and who withheld in the outcome's record — could
return anything, because every test that compared two records also compared two different
beacon values; `beacon_round.rs::at_net_10_the_record_binds_who_revealed_and_who_withheld`
compares five outcomes without a beacon that differ only in those lists (re-run: 3 caught).
`protocol` (`lottery.rs`, `randomness.rs`, and the renamed `lifecycle`/`orchestrator` lines;
the config's profile and `calibration`, `--cargo-test-arg=--test=…` with `inv10_beacon_seed`,
`exploration`, `lifecycle`, `properties`, `exact_outcomes`, `orchestrator`,
`lifecycle_model`, `orchestrator_model` and `panel_diversification`): 13 mutants — 9 caught,
4 unviable, none missed. cargo-mutants deletes no statement, so the `sort_unstable` and
`dedup` that make the lottery a function of the set are not mutated; the lottery test of
`inv10_beacon_seed.rs` pins them (every order and a repeat draw the same vector).

## Run 10 — T72: the draws' canonical candidate order

`cargo mutants --in-diff` on the T72 diff (`review.rs`, `governance.rs`; the config's
profile and `calibration`, `--cargo-test-arg=--test=…` with `draw_order`, `exact_outcomes`,
`properties`, `lifecycle`, `panel_diversification`, `inv10_beacon_seed` and
`reviewer_floor`): 12 mutants — 7 caught, 4 unviable, 1 missed. The survivor is
`governance.rs:76` `count < seats` → `<=`, the equivalent mutant of the table above
(`:85` before T72): at equality the fill loop stops before changing anything.

## Keeping it this way

- New decision logic gets a hand-computed or exact-outcome test, not only a range or
  an ordering check: those are what the survivors were.
- Re-run on the files you touched; a new survivor is either killed or added to the
  table above with its reason.
- The golden file changes only on purpose. Its diff is part of the review of any
  change to the engine.
