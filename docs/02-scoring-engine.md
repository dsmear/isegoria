# Scoring engine — mathematical specification

The engine is **deterministic**: given the same input (node×question ratings,
respondent×question answers), it produces the same output. It is the piece to
implement first; the simulations in `sim/` are its executable spec.

Notation: `u,v` nodes/reviewers; `j` questions (items); `i` respondents; `θ_i` the
respondent's latent competence.

## Level A — Bridging consensus

### A.1 Model

Matrix factorization with asymmetric regularization. Let `r_uj ∈ [0,1]` be node `u`'s
judgment of question `j`:

```
r̂_uj = μ + b_u + b_j + ⟨f_u , f_j⟩          f ∈ ℝ^d,  d = 1 or 2
```

- `μ` : global mean
- `b_u` : reviewer bias (individual severity/generosity)
- `b_j` : question intercept, reported by the fit; the score the gate reads is the
  side-balanced approval of §A.3 (D32)
- `f_u` : reviewer latent position (ideological axis, discovered from the data)
- `f_j` : how much the question "speaks" to that axis

Objective function, over `Ω` = the set of observed judgments:

```
L = Σ_(u,j)∈Ω (r_uj − r̂_uj)²  +  λ_b (Σ b_u² + Σ b_j²)  +  λ_f (Σ‖f_u‖² + Σ‖f_j‖²)
```

**with `λ_b ≫ λ_f`** — indicatively `λ_b = 0.15`, `λ_f = 0.03`.

### A.2 Why asymmetric regularization is the trick

By penalizing the intercepts heavily, the model is forced to explain approval *first*
through the polarization factors `⟨f_u,f_j⟩`. Only approval that **cannot** be
explained as "my faction likes it" survives in `b_j`.

- A question that one camp likes a lot → large `f_j`: the two sides' predicted approval
  differs and its mean stays low → **discarded**.
- A question approved by reviewers with opposite-sign `f_u` → both sides' predicted
  approval is high → **passes**.

### A.3 Score and threshold

**Bridge score (D32, T49; D42, T71): the side-balanced predicted approval.** After the
fit, the reviewers are split into two sides by the exact one-dimensional 2-means of
`f_u`: of the cuts of the sorted positions that split no run of equal values and leave
each side at least 5% of the reviewers (rounded up; `MIN_SIDE_PER_MILLE = 50`,
provisional, T25), the one with the largest between-side sum of squares. For each
question the model's predicted ratings `r̂_uj` — every reviewer's, whether or not they
rated it — are clipped to [0, 1] and averaged within each side, `A_j` and `B_j`, and the
score is

```
S_j = (A_j + B_j) / 2
```

so each side counts once, whatever its size, and the score lives on the scale of the
declared probability. Accepted if `S_j ≥ τ`, with `τ ≈ 0.80` **provisional**: on the
reference simulation the consensus items score 0.83–0.86, the partisan items 0.53–0.56
and the mildly partisan one 0.70 (`sim/bridging_irt_dif.py`). Calibrate on the pilot
(T25).

*Why not the intercept.* `b_j` is relative to its batch (`Σ_j b_j = 0` at every
stationary point, with `μ` unpenalized) and partly majoritarian: its origin is a gauge
fixed only by the penalties, which at the default `λ_b / λ_f` leaves 53–87% of the
camp-size effect in the score (paper §3.3–3.4, `docs/08` BRIDGE-008/009). The
predictions depend on neither. On mirror-image partisan items the side-balanced score
leaks at most 0.1 of the camp-size effect from 200 reviewers up (`AT-BR-08`); with
50–100 reviewers — a handful of minority ratings per item — the fit shrinks `f` and a
residual leak of 0.1–0.2 remains, a fraction of the intercept's. With a minority side of
about ten reviewers the side means are noisy: on the review's dataset at 95/5 one
consensus item in eight fell to 0.78. A floor on the minority side is a calibration
item (T25).

*The sides and the coverage (D42, T71).* The first pass of the characterization (`13`)
found three weaknesses in the score as T49 first built it, each confirmed on the engine's
own fits. The 2-means iteration started from the extremes of `f_u` stopped at a local
optimum when a few reviewers sat far out, and made them a side of their own: sides of 2
and 5 reviewers of 800, and in a bootstrap subsample 1 of 200, which dropped an item's
robust score from 0.91 to 0.56 while its full fit stayed at 0.91. An item that no
reviewer of one side had rated got that side's mean by extrapolation: a partisan item,
camp-balanced value 0.54, passed at 0.972 with no minority rating. Unclipped
predictions put scores outside [0, 1] (−0.28 to 1.31). The exact cut replaces the
iteration: it does not depend on the axis' origin or scale, a sign flip swaps the sides,
and two camps of distinct positions are separated whenever each holds at least 5% of the
reviewers. The predictions are clipped. And an item's **coverage** — the ratings its
less-rated side gave it, counting the axis reviewers with a positive weight — must reach
`MIN_COVERAGE = 1` (provisional, T25): below it the gate sends the item to the band's
extra round whatever its score, and the re-decision cannot pass it (`05` [5]). The panels
of `05` [4] are stratified on `f_u`, so an item one side never rated is rare; the floor
keeps it from being decided on an extrapolation when it happens.

**Polarization.** The gap `|A_j − B_j|` between the two sides is the question's
polarization. It feeds the appeal rule of `docs/05` [5b] — a question rejected with a
wide gap was rejected for polarization, not for a defect — with a provisional threshold
of 0.25, between the reference simulation's consensus items (≤ 0.02) and its mildly
partisan one (0.30). It replaces `|f_j|`, which *falls* as the camps become unequal
(`docs/08` §0-quinquies, BRIDGE-009).

**Uncertainty band (correction from testing).** Scores cluster near the threshold:
questions separated by thousandths end up one inside and one outside for pure noise.
Do not use a hard cut: define a band `[τ−ε, τ+ε]` in which questions go to
supplementary review instead of being decided by the exact value: an extra round of
`k_extra` reviewers drawn outside the first panel (`k_extra = 4`, provisional), whose
ratings are added to the first panel's before the score is re-decided against the plain
`τ` (`01` D26, T60; `05` [5]). `ε ≈ 0.02` provisional, about three times the bootstrap
spread of `S_j` on the reference fixtures (≤ 0.006); to be tuned with `k_extra` (T25).

*History.* Until T49 the gate read the intercept `b_j` against `τ ≈ 0.08` with
`ε ≈ 0.008`: the Community Notes reference value (0.40, on binary votes) proved
inadequate at this scale, and the useful value on the intercept was around 0.08.

### A.4 Robustness

- The objective is non-convex and has distinct local minima: a single start can land in
  a worse one, sometimes on the other side of `τ`. Fit from several deterministic
  starts (8 in the reference implementation) and keep the lowest objective; report `f`
  in a canonical sign (it is identified only up to sign).
- Run the fit on `m = 10` bootstrap subsamples (random removal of ~15% of judgments)
  and take the minimum of the side-balanced score over them, `min_s S_j^(s)`
  (pessimistic estimate): a question must pass in all repetitions.
- **`d = 2` is descoped** (`01` D31, recorded here by T39): the model has one latent
  axis. A second dimension — if a deployment shows one fracture axis is not enough (e.g.
  right/left + urban/rural), chosen empirically by explained variance on historical data
  — is a future option, not a plan. Community Notes essentially bridges on a binary
  axis; `d = 2` would be the generalization.
- **Reviewer floor (T39).** Nodes with fewer than `n_min = 30` reviews on record do not
  contribute to defining the `f` space, only to filling it: they are absent from the
  core fit — the axis `f_j`, the levels `b_j` and everyone else's position are exactly
  those of the fit without them — and are then *placed* on the fixed axis by ridge least
  squares over their own ratings (`Ratings::axis`, `orchestrator::axis_mask`,
  `N_MIN_REVIEWS`): a position of their own, no influence on anyone else, and no side in
  the side-balanced score. (Pinning their `f_u` at 0 instead would not do: the model is
  invariant to `(f_u, b_j) → (f_u + c, b_j − c·f_j)`, so a single pinned reviewer with a
  few extreme ratings drags the whole axis's origin to itself.) A founder defines the
  axis from the start (the founder set is declared heterogeneous, `05` §Cold start),
  otherwise the first epochs would have no axis. Until it is established a newcomer
  weighs 0 anyway (`01` D36) and is assigned from the position it has (`05` [4]).
  Provisional (T25).

### A.5 Optimization

L-BFGS-B with an analytic gradient. The gradient with respect to each parameter block
is in the prototype (`sim/bridging_irt_dif.py`, function `fit`). Attention point for
reproducibility: fix the initialization seed and the iteration order. The transcendental
functions (`exp`, `ln`, `ln_1p`, `cos`, `pow`) come from one pure-Rust implementation
(the `libm` crate, `scoring::fmath`), not from the platform's libm, so the same input
gives the same bits on every platform and in every build profile (INV-7, `docs/08`
AT-BR-04).

---

## Level B — Empirical validation

Here nobody votes. You measure, on the pilot data. **Always in batches of questions,
never on a single item** (see the latent-class DIF section and
`sim/latent_dif_and_capacity.py`).

### B.1 IRT model

3-parameter model (3PL); the 2PL (without `c`) is enough for small batches:

```
P(X_ij = 1 | θ_i) = c_j + (1 − c_j) · [ 1 + exp(−a_j (θ_i − b_j)) ]⁻¹
```

- `a_j` : **discrimination** — how well the question separates those who know from
  those who don't
- `b_j` : **difficulty**
- `c_j` : **pseudo-guessing**

### B.2 Retention criteria

| Statistic | Threshold | Meaning of failure |
|---|---|---|
| `a_j` | ≥ 0.6 | the question distinguishes nothing: it is noise |
| `b_j` | −2.5 ≤ b_j ≤ 2.5 | too easy or too hard to be informative |
| `c_j` | ≤ 0.35 | answer is guessable |
| Infit/Outfit MNSQ | 0.7 – 1.3 | the question is not coherent with the construct |
| `r_pbis` (point-biserial) | ≥ 0.20 | same, classical version |

**Point-biserial**: correlation between "correct answer to this item" (0/1) and total
score on the rest of the test. If **negative**, the answer key is almost always wrong
(those who know more get it wrong more) — in testing this correctly caught an item
with an inverted key.

### B.3 DIF analysis on latent groups — the neutrality test

Establishes whether a question is politically biased **without knowing anyone's
identity or attributes**.

Idea: two people with the *same* competence `θ` but from different groups must have
the same probability of answering correctly. If they don't, the question is measuring
group membership.

**Variant 1 — logistic regression on continuous `f`** (uses the Level A latent axis):

```
logit P(X_ij = 1) = β₀ + β₁ θ_i + β₂ f_i + β₃ (θ_i · f_i)
```

- `β₂ ≠ 0` → at equal competence, the question favors one end of the axis (uniform DIF)
- `β₃ ≠ 0` → the advantage varies with competence level (non-uniform DIF)

Operational threshold: `|β₂| > 0.40` → reject. In parallel, discretizing `f` into
tertiles, Mantel–Haenszel with ETS classification:

```
Δ_MH = −2.35 · ln(α_MH)
|Δ_MH| < 1.0        → class A   accepted
1.0 ≤ |Δ_MH| < 1.5  → class B   accepted with monitoring
|Δ_MH| ≥ 1.5        → class C   REJECTED
```

**Variant 2 — latent-class IRT mixture** (independent of Level A):

> **Revised by D37 and D38 (T53, T54 and T55 done).** Error in the ability proxy creates
> spurious latent classes (paper §4.5): the re-check runs only when the anchors' KR-20 on
> the batch's respondents is ≥ 0.90 (`irt::KR20_MIN`, enforced by `revalidate_batch_latent`
> — T53), and since T54 the fit is the target model below — the anchors inside the
> likelihood and `θ` integrated out (`scoring::latent`) — which finds no mixture where
> the proxy did. The differential gap of the retired proxy model is a diagnostic only
> (`MixtureDif::differential`): it inverts in a campaign. An item whose DIF concerns
> knowledge of a fact established by a primary source becomes a *contested fact* in a
> balanced pool instead of being rejected (D38, T55, done): §B.7 defines the pool, its DTF
> statistic and the balanced draw, §B.5 the source check that classifies.

```
P(x_i) = Σ_g π_g ∫ Π_{a∈A} P_a(x_ia | θ) · Π_{j∈J} P_jg(x_ij | θ) · φ(θ; η_g, 1) dθ,   η_0 = 0
P_a(x = 1 | θ)  = [1 + exp(−a_a (θ − b_a))]⁻¹          the anchors: one parameter set for every class
P_jg(x = 1 | θ) = [1 + exp(−a_jg (θ − b_jg))]⁻¹        the trial items: per class
DIF_j = max_{g,h} | b_jg − b_jh |                       reject if DIF_j > 1.0  (provisional, see below)
```

The population is a mixture of `G` classes with proportions `π_g`; the classes have no
label and do not need one. The anchors (`A`, the DIF-free items the respondents also
answered) enter the likelihood with class-invariant parameters and each class has its own
ability mean `η_g`, so a class-wide shift is attributed to ability, not to the trial
items: DIF is a trial item's departure from the anchors' account of the classes. `θ` is
integrated on a fixed grid (41 nodes over `[−5, 5]`); `G` is chosen by BIC. **This
variant is what makes DIF compatible with full anonymity**: in testing, with ≥2
distorted questions in a batch, it estimates a difficulty gap `DIF_j` of 1.7–1.9 (the
true `2δ` = 1.8) on the defective ones when four or six of eight are shifted — 3.6 and
1.1 when only two are — and under 0.15 on the clean ones, without ever observing the
axis.

*Why the anchors are in the likelihood.* The first implementation fitted the trial items
on a proxy — the standardized anchor total as `θ` (`dif::mixture_dif`). Error in the
proxy makes the trial items positively dependent even without DIF (paper Prop. 10), so
on null batches the proxy model finds classes that do not exist: at N = 6,000 it selects
two classes with 10, 20 and 30 anchors (KR-20 0.68–0.89), flagging 8, 2 and 0 clean
items; the target model selects one class at every anchor count. In a campaign — most
of a batch shifted the same way — the proxy's differential gap inverts, while the target
model flags exactly the shifted items (`08` AT-DIF-12). The proxy model is retired from
the production path (`revalidate_batch_latent` runs the target model on the anchors it
admits) and kept for the fixtures and the sim reproduction.

*Threshold.* The literature value for `DIF_j` is 0.5 logit. The reference
implementation rejects at **1.0** on the gap, and only when the selected fit converged
and the BIC prefers a mixture (two or more classes) over one class. On the target model
the null gaps are 0 (one class selected) or far below 1.0 and the campaign gaps far
above it, so 1.0 is kept, provisional until the false-positive / power study (`10`
T24/T25) sets it (`08` DIF-006, DIF-008).

*Reference implementation (T40, T54).* `G ∈ {1, …, 4}` and uniform (shared `a_j`) vs
non-uniform (per-class `a_jg`) DIF are chosen together by BIC, each candidate fitted from
several seeded starts with an analytic gradient (the EM artificial data: per node the
expected respondents, per respondent the class posterior and its first `θ`-moment); a
class holding under 5% of the respondents does not define `DIF_j` (its difficulties are
unidentified). The verdict reads the difficulty gap only, as above: a per-class
*discrimination* gap is estimated and reported (`a_gap`) but has no threshold yet (to be
set with the uniform one by the false-positive / power study).

**Critical requirement: validate in batches.** A single distorted question in
isolation is unidentifiable (in testing: 1 of 8 → invisible; 2 of 8 → detected). The
real threat is a *campaign* to tilt the bank, and it is that which becomes visible in
batches. Periodically re-run the analysis on the whole active pool, where even
scattered distortions add up.

**Multi-axis.** Test on more than one latent axis, including at least one that
captures the socio-economic fracture. Variant 2 surfaces it by itself: in testing a
question neutral on the political axis (DIF ≈ 0) but distorted on education (DIF ≈
0.66) was missed by looking only at the political axis. Bridging protects against
factional capture, not against elite consensus against the general public.

### B.4 Iterative purification (mandatory)

`θ` must be estimated on a set of **anchor items** already certified free of DIF,
otherwise the biased items contaminate the very measure used to judge them:

```
1. estimate θ using all items (or the anchors)
2. identify the items with DIF
3. remove them
4. re-estimate θ using only the clean items (anchors)
5. re-test all items with the new θ
6. repeat until the set of discarded items stops changing
```

In the prototype, `θ` is estimated on 30 anchor items external to the batch under
validation — enough for the reference fixtures, not for the production re-check, which
requires the anchors' KR-20 on the batch's respondents to reach 0.90 (about 40 anchors of
this design; `01` D37, T53): the standardized total is a proxy for `θ` only as reliable as
its anchors, and below that reliability the mixture reads proxy error as a latent class.

### B.5 Upstream admissibility

Psychometrics does not save you from badly conceived questions. Strict taxonomy:

- **Admitted**: verifiable procedural and institutional facts, with a **mandatory
  citation to a primary source** (Official Gazette, parliamentary act, official
  dataset).
- **Rejected by construction**: normative items ("is it right that…"), predictive,
  counterfactual, and items that attribute causes to contested phenomena.

Disputes over an item are resolved by an evidentiary procedure (comparison with the
source), not by a vote.

**The source check (`01` D38).** The evidentiary procedure as it decides whether an item
the latent check flags (§B.3) is a *contested fact* (§B.7). It answers one question —
does the cited primary source establish the item's key? — from the record, in steps
anyone can redo, and asks nobody whether the item is true, fair or important:

1. *The citation was committed at deposit.* The primary source is a structured citation
   (`03`: an act identifier, never an arbitrary URL): the registry, the act's identifier
   in it, the locator inside the act (article, paragraph, table cell) and the passage or
   data found there. It is part of the draft's content id (`deposit::Draft::content_id`),
   so it cannot be changed once the item has shown DIF.
2. *The registry is a primary one:* it is on the closed list of primary registries — the
   Official Gazette, the parliamentary records, the official statistical datasets — kept
   by meta-governance (`05` §Meta-level governance).
3. *The passage is authentic:* the act the identifier names, as the registry publishes
   it, holds the cited passage or data at the locator.
4. *The key follows from the passage:* the item is built from a template (`05` [9])
   whose key is a declared, deterministic function of the cited data — the datum itself,
   or a comparison of two figures — and that function, applied to them, gives the keyed
   answer.

The item is a contested fact only if all four steps hold. A key that rests on an
interpretation of the source — something a reader must judge rather than a function can
compute — fails step 4, and the item is rejected on DIF as before. Step 4 limits the
contested pool to data-bound facts (dates, figures, votes, the text of a provision),
which the taxonomy above already favours. The check runs only on flagged items, at the
pilot and at each re-validation (an act amended since no longer holds the cited passage
and fails step 3; a repealed one makes the item obsolete, `05` [9]). The
protocol takes its verdict as an input (`source_verified` in `lifecycle::Event`); the
check itself in code — the citation type, the registry list, the template's key rule — is
Phase 3 work (`10` T68).

### B.6 Sample sizes and the minimum viable network

The `~300` and `~1500` respondent counts are not arbitrary; they come from
psychometric sample-size requirements. They are still **calibration targets** to be
confirmed with a formal power analysis before a real pilot — this section states the
reasoning and the constraints, not a proof.

**Where the two pilot sizes come from.**

- **Pilot 1 (~300)** is a cheap classical screen (proportion correct, point-biserial,
  a rough 2PL). Classical item statistics stabilize around 100–200 respondents; a 2PL
  fit wants ~250–500. `~300` is the smallest count that gives a reliable first cut —
  no larger, because respondents are the scarce resource (`01` D11).
- **Pilot 2 (~1500)** is the full IRT + DIF stage, which needs enough people *at every
  competence level and in every latent subgroup* (DIF compares people of equal `θ`):
  3PL wants ~500–1000+, and Mantel–Haenszel / logistic DIF wants ≥200 per group. `1500`
  covers this **when a grouping signal exists** (the observed group, or `f` from Level
  A).

**The anonymity ↔ sample-size tension.** The anonymity-compatible detector is the
latent-class mixture (§B.3, Variant 2), which must estimate class membership *and*
per-class item parameters without observing the group. It is far more data-hungry:
`sim/latent_dif_and_capacity.py` uses **NT = 3000**, not 1500. So:

> **1500 is optimistic for the fully-anonymous variant.** For latent-class,
> multi-axis DIF, budget ~2500–3000+ respondents per batch, rising with the number of
> axes/classes sought. Giving up observed group labels is paid for in sample size.

**Three distinct floors on network size** (person-nodes, `04`), of different natures:

1. **Evidence-filter correctness (the binding one).** Each batch needs ~1500–3000
   *distinct* respondents — not many answers from few people: DIF needs different people
   spread across competence and latent groups. Below ~1500–2000 active answerers in the
   validation window, Level B cannot run as specified. The floors are enforced on
   persons: the protocol counts the `Respond` nullifiers admitted to the batch, never the
   answer rows (T65).
2. **Level A identifiability.** The matrix factorization recovers the axis `f` only with
   enough overlapping judgments; the spec already sets `n_min = 30` reviews per node to
   enter the `f`-space (§A.4) and `k = 7–11` reviewers per item. This needs at least a
   few hundred active reviewers spanning the axis.
3. **Anonymity (a privacy floor, often forgotten).** Anonymity is a form of
   k-anonymity: you hide in the crowd. In a small network, statistical deanonymization
   (`03`: stylometry, timing, topic choice) becomes easy — a few hundred authors is not
   enough to hide 200 questions from one ID. There is a size below which the system
   *functions* but is no longer *anonymous*.

**A fourth precondition, on the anchors rather than the network.** The latent re-check
also requires the anchors the batch's respondents answered to be reliable: KR-20 ≥ 0.90
(`01` D37, T53; `pilot::admit_anchors`). Below it the batch is refused like a short
sample, because a noisy `θ` proxy is read by the mixture as a latent class (`08` DIF-010).

**Throughput** (a floor on usefulness, not correctness) follows `01` D10:
`validatable_questions/month ≈ (nodes × answers_per_node_month) / answers_per_question`.
With 10,000 nodes × 50 answers ÷ 1500 ≈ 333 questions/month. Halving the network halves
output; it does not break correctness.

| Active person-nodes | What is possible |
|---|---|
| < ~1,500 | Evidence filter not runnable as specified; only a weak Level A |
| ~2,000–3,000 | Minimum viable: one batch at a time, anonymous DIF at the edge, fragile anonymity |
| ~10,000 | ~300 questions/month, stable latent-class DIF, good k-anonymity |
| 100,000+ | Robust on throughput, multi-axis DIF, and privacy |

### B.7 Contested facts and differential test functioning (`01` D38)

DIF shows that an item measures a second dimension on which the latent classes differ;
whether that dimension is a nuisance is a judgment (paper §4.7). When the key is a fact
a primary source establishes, the second dimension is knowledge of the fact: one class
is misinformed about it. Rejecting such items would bar every fact a camp disputes from
the bank, and the appeal of `05` [5b] could not recover them — Level B would reject them
for the reason Level A did. So an item the latent check flags (§B.3) goes one of two
ways:

- its key passes the source check (§B.5) → a **contested fact**, kept in a separate
  *contested pool* (from the pilot, or from the active pool at re-validation);
- otherwise → rejected at the pilot, retired at re-validation, as before.

A test draws contested facts only in sets whose differential test functioning (DTF)
stays within a tolerance, so the test as a whole favours no latent class although each
of its contested facts does.

**DTF within one fit.** Let `F` be a target-model fit (§B.3) in which the items of a set
`S` were trial items, with counted classes `g` (share ≥ 5%, as for `DIF_j`), shares
`π_g` renormalized over them, ability means `η_g` and per-class curves
`P_jg(θ) = σ(a_jg (θ − b_jg))`. At ability `θ` the expected-score difference between
classes `g` and `h` is `Δ_gh(S; θ) = Σ_{j∈S} [P_jg(θ) − P_jh(θ)]`, and

```
DTF_F(S) = max_{g,h} ∫ |Δ_gh(S; θ)| f_F(θ) dθ          f_F(θ) = Σ_g π_g φ(θ; η_g, 1)
```

— the unsigned DTF (Chalmers, Counsell & Flora, 2016) on the number-correct scale, over
the batch's own ability distribution, at the worst pair of classes; the integral is the
fit's quadrature, 41 nodes over `[−5, 5]` with weights `∝ f_F(θ_q)` (`scoring::dtf`).
Items that lean the same way add up. Items that lean opposite ways cancel, but only
where their curves overlap: the absolute value inside the integral does not let a set
favour one class at low ability and the other at high ability. One item has the DTF of
its own curves; two mirror items cancel exactly; one counted class gives 0.

**Across fits: a bound, not a statistic.** The classes of two fits are not the same
classes. Labels are arbitrary per fit and nothing links them: the anchors carry no class
information (their parameters are class-invariant by construction), and matching
classes through respondents who answered both batches would link a person's answers
across batches into a latent-class profile (invariant #1, `03` statistical
deanonymization). The DTF of items from several fits is therefore not identified; a
bound is. For a test `T`,

```
D(T) = Σ_F DTF_F(T ∩ F)          summed over the fits of its contested facts
```

bounds the test's DTF between any two classes of the population, whatever the
correspondence between the fits' classes (by the triangle inequality: at worst every
fit's worst pair points the same way). Active-pool items enter at zero: they passed the
DIF check. Contested facts cancel only against facts measured in the same fit, so the
periodic re-validation (`05` [8]) re-fits contested facts together: a batch of contested
facts from different fits gives them one set of classes, and an item's curves are
always those of the latest fit that measured it.

**Tolerance.** A test's contested facts are admissible when `D(T) ≤ DTF_MAX`,
`DTF_MAX = 0.10` score points, provisional (T24/T25): about the DTF of one item of
negligible DIF — at the ETS class-A boundary (`|Δ_MH| = 1`, a log-odds gap of 0.43) a
mid-difficulty item has 0.08. For scale, with `a = 1.25` and two equal classes: one item
with a difficulty gap of 1.8 has 0.41 at difficulty 0 and 0.21 at difficulty 2; two such
items leaning opposite ways have 0.00 at equal difficulty, 0.04 at 0.25 apart, 0.07 at
0.5 and 0.14 at 1.0. The bound is computed on the fitted curves, and it is a point
estimate: on a batch fitted at N = 3,000 the fitted DTF of each set was within 0.03 of the
true one, and on two batches fitted through the production gate a drawn pair with a fitted
bound of 0.076 had a true DTF of 0.104 (`08` AT-PRO-08). Its sampling error, like the
tolerance, is part of the characterization (T24/T25).

**The balanced draw.** A test with `n` contested slots draws them from the beacon
(INV-10; `randomness::CONTESTED`, keyed on the test's number) among the selections with
`D(T) ≤ DTF_MAX`. The fits are visited in a seeded order; for each, the candidates are
its subsets of at most `n` contested facts whose own DTF is within the tolerance (the
empty one included); a table of the least bound that completes `n` from the fits not yet
visited keeps only the candidates that can still be completed, and one is drawn
uniformly among them. So the draw fails only when no balanced selection of `n` exists —
it then reports the sizes that do — and every balanced selection has a positive
probability. The bound is summed in fixed point (each fit's DTF rounded up to `2⁻³²`
score points), so the budget is exact (`protocol::contested`). The draw is a function
of the pool's content and the seed alone: the pool keeps a canonical order — within a
fit, the members by content id; the fits by their least member, unique since a fact
belongs to one fit — so the seeded visiting order, the enumeration of each fit's
candidates and the order of the drawn facts owe nothing to the order in which facts were
recorded, re-measured or retired. Two replicas holding the same facts in the same fits
draw the same test from the same seed, and whoever records the facts cannot pick the
test by the order of recording (the order-dependence T37 records for the lottery).

**Scores.** A contested fact is admitted to the bank. Its Level B outcome for the
evaluator score is 1, as for an item that reaches the pool (§C.2) — scoring it 0 would
pay reviewers to predict the rejection of true facts a camp disputes — and an appealed
item that becomes a contested fact promotes the appeal (§C.1, `05` [5b]).

## Level C — Node reputation

Two **separate** scores, on unlinkable pseudonyms (see `01` D5). Never combined.

### C.1 Author score `C_a`

Hierarchical Bayesian model with shrinkage. Let `q_j ∈ [0,1]` be the final quality of
item `j` (a function of the Level B statistics):

```
q_j  ~  Beta( ψ_a · κ , (1 − ψ_a) · κ )
ψ_a  ~  Beta( α₀ , β₀ )              weak prior, e.g. α₀ = 2, β₀ = 3
```

Point estimate (posterior mean, with time decay):

```
          α₀ + Σ_j w_j q_j
C_a  =  ─────────────────────      w_j = exp(−Δt_j / T),  T ≈ 18 months
        α₀ + β₀ + Σ_j w_j
```

Shrinkage is indispensable: a node with 2 of 2 items accepted must not be worth as
much as one with 180 of 200. Example with `Beta(2,3)`: author A (2/2) → 4/7 ≈ 57%;
author B (180/200) → 182/205 ≈ 89%.

**Use.** `C_a` governs the **rate limit on proposals**, not the vote weight:

```
q_a = q_min + (q_max − q_min) · C_a
```

**Appeal stake (`01` D27, `05` [5b]).** An appeal is a pseudo-observation *inside* this
average, not a deduction from it: filing appends `q = 0` at `Δt = 0` (the escrow); the
verdict replaces it with the item's real `q_j` if the pilot promotes the item — to the
active pool, or to the contested pool (§B.7) — and leaves it otherwise. The stake floor
is the prior mean `α₀ / (α₀ + β₀)` (0.4 with `Beta(2,3)`): an author files only while
`C_a` covers it, so a failed appeal costs the next one until the evidence has restored
the average. There is no additive gain — the reward for being
right is the good observation itself (`protocol::appeal`, T61). Floor provisional (T25).

### C.2 Evaluator score `S_u` and review weight `w_u`

> **Revised by D33 and D35 (T50 and T52, done).** The ratio-form Brier skill score of the
> first design is not a proper scoring rule (paper Prop. 12): it paid a dissenter to move
> toward the crowd. Since T50 the score is the leave-one-out difference score below and
> the weight lives on the odds scale. Since T52 the scored items are the live outcomes
> too, with the randomized exploration that keeps the score proper when the gate decides
> which outcomes are observed (§Exploration below).

The reviewer does not give a binary judgment: they **declare a probability** `p_uj`
that the item passes Level B empirical validation. On every scored item — a golden item
(`05` §Golden items) or a live item whose outcome `o_j ∈ {0,1}` is known (`01` D35, T52) —
the forecast is scored with a **strictly proper** rule, which makes honesty the optimal
strategy whatever the crowd says:

```
S_uj = (p̄_{−u,j} − o_j)² − (p_uj − o_j)²      p̄_{−u,j} = Σ_{v≠u} w_v p_vj / Σ_{v≠u} w_v
```

`p̄_{−u,j}` is the weight-adjusted mean forecast of the *other* panelists (`01` D23's
crowd baseline minus the reviewer scored). The score is the reviewer's Brier improvement
over the crowd: positive when they are right where the crowd is wrong, exactly 0 for a
reviewer who reports the crowd's forecast, negative for noise or block voting. Its
expectation is maximized by the true belief, by exactly `Σ_j (p_uj − q_uj)²` over any
other report (`08` AT-REP-05).

**Fundamental property.** Someone who replicates the consensus gets `S_u = 0`. You
gain reputation only by being right **when the crowd is wrong**. This is the incentive
needed against majority capture.

`S_u` is the mean of `S_uj` over the reviewer's `k_u` scored items — the symmetric
long-window mean of `01` D34 (the change detector on the per-item scores is T51).

**Exploration (`01` D35, T52).** Golden items alone are too few (about one every two
epochs per reviewer). A reviewer is therefore scored on every reviewed item whose Level
B outcome is known: the golden items, every live item that reaches a pilot (a pass — a
contested fact is one, §B.7 — or a screen or DIF rejection: `o_j = 0`), and a random
`ε = 5%` of the items the gate rejects, drawn from the public beacon (`protocol::exploration`, keyed on the admitted
slot) and piloted for measurement only — never entering the pool. Scoring only the
outcomes the gate lets through would not be proper: the report then decides whether its
own outcome is observed, and the bare observed score pays a reviewer to report on the
gate's side (`08` AT-REP-06: 0.08 for reporting 0.50 against 0.0045 for an honest 0.40).
Each observed score enters the mean at its inverse inclusion probability `1/π_j` — 1
for an item that entered the pilot on its own account, `1/ε` for an explored rejection —
over every reviewed item, observed or not:

```
S_u = ( Σ_{j observed} S_uj / π_j ) / N_u        N_u = the reviewer's reviewed items after the gate
```

Its expectation is the mean with every outcome observed, whatever the gate decided
(paper, "Exploration restores properness"), so the true belief stays the unique optimum.
`k_u`, the count that decides probation and the shrinkage, is the observed items. The
change detector (D34) reads the *unweighted* observed scores against their own mean, so
one explored item cannot fire it by its weight. Exploration also measures the gate's
false-negative rate — how many rejected items would have passed Level B — and costs
about `ε` of pilot capacity. The draw is grind-free with the beacon of `01` D41 (T37).

**Use.** `S_u` weights the review vote, on the odds scale and shrunk by the number of
scored items:

```
w_u = exp( γ · S_u · k_u / (k_u + k₀) )       γ ≈ 35,  k₀ ≈ 100   (provisional, T25)
w_u ← min(w_max, w_u),   w_max = 3 × median(w)  over the reviewers who carry weight
```

A crowd-level reviewer weighs 1; one reliably 0.02 better than the crowd weighs about
double; the cap binds on an outlier (it never did on a score in `(0,1)`, `08` G-12).
Shrinkage stops luck from buying weight: with 16 scored items one standard error of luck
(0.025) is worth ×2.4 without it and ×1.13 with it. A new pseudonym has weight 0 until
30 scored outcomes (`01` D36, `03` P2), then the shrinkage takes over.

*History.* Until T50 the score was the Brier skill score against the crowd's mean
forecast, `BSS_u = 1 − Σ_j (p_uj − o_j)² / Σ_j (p̄_j − o_j)²`, squashed by
`E_u = σ(γ·BSS_u)` and used as `w_u = min(w_max, E_u)`. A ratio of two sums is not an
expectation of a score: with one item the optimal report satisfies
`logit p* = logit q + 2 logit b` (paper Prop. 12) — a reviewer who believes 0.30 while
the crowd says 0.65 was best off reporting 0.60. The fixture oracle `levelc_bss.csv`
still reproduces that function (`08` REPUTATION-002); on it the difference score tells
the same story (the expert beats the crowd, the followers do not) and stays proper.

### C.3 Judgments without verifiable truth

For dimensions that never receive an empirical verdict (formal clarity, source
quality, tone), there is no `o_j`. A **peer-prediction** mechanism with correlated
agreement (Dasgupta–Ghosh), incentive-compatible without ground truth. For reviewer
`p` and reference reviewer `q`:

```
Score(p) = 1[ x_p(shared_item) = x_q(shared_item) ]
         − 1[ x_p(t_1) = x_q(t_2) ]          t_1, t_2 non-shared items
```

The second term subtracts baseline agreement (chance or common bias). Reporting the
honest signal is the highest-payoff equilibrium among symmetric strategies.

Richer variant: **Bayesian Truth Serum** (Prelec). Each reviewer declares (a) their
own judgment, (b) the expected distribution of the others. The **surprisingly common**
answer is rewarded — more frequent than the group predicted. It extracts information
from the informed minority.

### C.4 Temporal dynamics and cap

> **Revised by D33, D34 and D36 (T50, T51 — done).** The cap applies on the odds scale,
> where it binds, probation lasts 30 scored outcomes, and the asymmetric update of the
> first design is replaced by the symmetric mean of §C.2 plus a change detector.

- **Change detector (`01` D34).** The weight reads `S_u`, the mean of the reviewer's
  per-item scores (`probation::SkillTrack`). Against that mean, a one-sided CUSUM on the
  per-item scores watches for a sustained *drop* — a reviewer who has built a reputation
  and starts spending it:

  ```
  s ← max(0, s + (S_u − S_uj) − k)        alarm when s > h;   k = 0.03, h = 1.5 (provisional, T25)
  ```

  It runs only once the reviewer is out of probation (a mean over few items is no
  reference). On an alarm the reviewer returns to probation: the mean, the count and the
  statistic restart, so the weight is 0 until 30 new scored outcomes and shrunk again
  afterwards. It reacts to a change, not to variance: a cautious reviewer with noisy
  scores around a good mean raises nothing. In the paper's simulation, `k = 0.03`,
  `h = 1.5` give 0.07 false alarms per 1,000 scored items and catch a reviewer who starts
  flipping 20% of forecasts after a median of 36 items (`08` AT-REP-07).
- `w_max = 3 × median(w)`, a hard cap recomputed each epoch over the reviewers who
  carry weight (founders at 1 and established reviewers at their odds weight, not
  probationers at 0; `orchestrator::epoch_weight_cap`). Limits the damage of a single
  event.

*History.* Until T51 `E_u` rose slowly and fell fast (an asymmetric moving average),
meant to make the long-con attack unprofitable. It penalized variance, not error: its
stationary level sat far below the true mean, and a cautious reviewer who beat the crowd
(true +0.009) was held at −0.061 while a crowd copier stayed at 0 (paper §5.5).

## Anti-collusion (coordination detection)

> **Revised by D39 and D40 (T56 and T57, done).** Within an epoch two reviewers share
> under one item (paper §6.3), and raw correlations cannot separate a cartel from
> like-minded honest reviewers. Detection reads the correlation of model residuals over
> long histories; a detected cluster limits panel assignment (at most one member per
> panel, `05` [4]) instead of losing weight. The sublinear discount below is kept in the
> engine for analysis and is not applied on the protocol path.

**Detection (`01` D39, T56).** For every rating the bridging fit leaves a residual,
`e_uj = r_uj − r̂_uj` with `r̂_uj = μ + b_u + b_j + f_u·f_j`. The model already explains
the agreement of two honest reviewers who share a position: their residuals do not
correlate. A cartel agrees beyond the model: its residuals do.

```
1. residuals accumulate per reviewer and item across epochs   (ResidualHistory)
2. a pair (u, v) is read only once it shares ≥ 30 items         (min_shared)
3. ρ_uv = Pearson correlation of the shared residuals
4. flagged if ρ_uv ≥ ρ_min = 0.7 and the permutation p-value ≤ 0.001 (999 permutations, seeded)
5. clusters by average linkage over the flagged pairs: two groups merge only while the mean
   correlation over all their cross pairs (an unflagged pair counting 0) is ≥ ρ_min
```

On the paper's dataset (200 reviewers in two camps, 60 items, a cartel of 10 minority
members rating 5 majority-favoured items at 1.0 with jitter σ = 0.05): honest pairs of
the same camp correlate at +0.015 on residuals (+0.93 on raw ratings, level with the
cartel's +0.92), the cartel at +0.89; every cartel pair is flagged and no honest pair,
where the raw rule — `|ρ| ≥ threshold` with connected components — chains the whole
majority camp into one cluster. `ρ_min` is 0.7 because at 0.5 four of the 18,000 honest
pairs reach it by chance. Average linkage means one spurious pair never chains an honest
reviewer to a cartel, and opposite camps, whose residuals are uncorrelated, are never
joined. All thresholds provisional (T25).

**What a cluster does (`01` D40, T57).** A panel holds at most one member of each
cluster, the band's extra round included. Nobody's weight changes: false positives cost
their members only co-assignment, and splitting a cartel to evade detection buys nothing
that assignment does not already deny.

**Sublinear discount (`01` D7, analysis only).** The individual cap does not stop a
cartel of coordinated nodes; the engine keeps the discount as a measure of a cluster's
influence:

```
W(G) = ( Σ_{u∈G} w_u )^α,   α ≈ 0.5
```

A coalition of `k` nodes voting identically counts as `√k`: 500 coordinated ≈ 22
independent. It is not applied to the protocol's weights: it can be evaded by splitting
(paper Prop. 17) and it penalizes honest like-minded reviewers, which the residual
detector no longer confuses with a cartel.

## What the engine does NOT solve (structural limits from testing)

1. **The true-but-divisive false negative.** Bridging does not tell a true,
   polarizing fact from one-sided propaganda: they produce the same voting pattern,
   and **no threshold saves it**. This is the most serious limitation. Mitigation: the
   appeal-to-evidence channel (`05`), not a change to the engine.
2. **The elite-consensus blind spot.** A question can pass bridging and political DIF
   yet be strongly distorted on a socio-economic axis. Mitigation: multi-axis DIF
   (B.3), which must be actively sought.
3. **~30% survival rate.** In testing, 3 of 10 questions reach the pool. Write ~3× the
   items you need.
4. **The threshold is a blade.** See the uncertainty band (A.3).
5. **Human judgment predicts validity poorly.** Level A is in effect anti-spam against
   partisan questions, not a quality indicator. The real verdict is Level B.
