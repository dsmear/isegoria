# Working paper: the mathematics of Isegoria

**Opinion as Filter, Evidence as Verdict: The Mathematics of Isegoria, an Authority-Free
Mechanism for Validating Test Items** (working paper, version 0.2, September 2026).

- **PDF:** [`main.pdf`](main.pdf), built from the sources in this directory.
- **Describes:** the code at commit `2ee5e79` and the design decisions D32–D41 of
  [`docs/01`](../docs/01-decisions.md) (commit `7507eab`); D32 is implemented since T49
  (2026-09-24), the rest are planned (roadmap `docs/10` Phase 1.1). The paper is a dated
  snapshot: what the repository changed after it is listed below
  ([Since version 0.2](#since-version-02)). The living specification is still
  [`docs/02-scoring-engine.md`](../docs/02-scoring-engine.md) and
  [`docs/08-formal-specification.md`](../docs/08-formal-specification.md). A new version of the
  paper names the commit it describes.
- **Versions:** 0.1, the analysis; 0.2, adds Section 7, *Adopted revisions*.

## What it contains

The paper states the scoring mechanism formally: bridging (Level A), IRT with latent-class DIF
(Level B), reputation (Level C) and the anti-collusion discount. The identity and network layers
are abstracted as explicit assumptions. Each result is labelled *proved*, *empirical*, *design*
or *open*. The analysis finds five properties that the design documents do not anticipate. Each
comes with a proof or a reproducible experiment and a candidate correction:

1. **The bridging gate is relative to its batch.** With an unpenalized global mean, item
   intercepts sum to zero at every stationary point. The six consensus items of the reference
   simulation pass (5 of 6) when fitted with divisive items and all fail when fitted alone.
2. **The bridge score is partly majoritarian.** The origin of the latent axis is a gauge fixed only
   by the regularization. In a two-camp model the intercept interpolates between the
   camp-balanced and the camp-size-weighted mean with weight `1/(1+ρ)`,
   `ρ ≈ (λ_b/λ_f)·sqrt(S/n)`. At the default penalties the leak is 0.53–0.87 for 50–3,200
   reviewers.
3. **Latent-class DIF is identified by pairs, and it is confounded by error in θ.** A single biased
   item carries 250–300 times less information than a biased pair. An imperfect ability proxy
   creates spurious latent classes. On null batches the production detector flags clean items
   when θ comes from 10 or 20 anchors, and at 30 anchors it passes by a margin of 0.01–0.06.
4. **The evaluator's skill score is not proper.** Against a crowd baseline `b`, the optimal report
   on one scored item satisfies `logit p* = logit q + 2 logit b`, which pushes dissenters toward
   the crowd. A leave-one-out difference score is strictly proper and still gives exactly zero to
   a reviewer who copies the crowd. The weight cap `3 × median` never binds for `E_u ∈ (0,1)`.
5. **The anti-collusion discount is only as strong as its detector.** At design scale two
   reviewers share under one item per epoch, so random assignment carries the per-epoch defence.

## Adopted revisions (version 0.2, Section 7)

| Finding | Revision | Decision / task |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2 | side-balanced bridge score: sides by 2-means on `f_u`, predicted approval averaged per side, each side counts once; absolute threshold ≈ 0.80. Leak falls to between −0.08 and 0.00; the score is stable to ±0.01 with or without other items and decoys | D32 / T49 (done 2026-09-24) |
| 4 | leave-one-out difference score; odds weights `exp(γ·S·k/(k+100))`, `γ ≈ 35`; CUSUM change detector instead of the asymmetric update; outcomes of live items plus 5% randomized exploration of rejections (proper by Prop. 21); probation of 30 | D33–D36 / T50–T52 |
| 3 | anchor KR-20 ≥ 0.90 before a latent re-check (about 40 anchors); the differential gap only as a diagnostic (it inverts in a campaign); θ inside the likelihood as the target model | D37 / T53, T54 |
| — | contested facts (DIF on knowledge, key backed by a primary source) in a balanced pool | D38 / T55 |
| 5 | coordination detected on model residuals over long histories (honest pairs flagged 50.6% → 0%); clusters limit panel co-assignment instead of losing weight | D39, D40 / T56, T57 |
| — | beacon: commit-reveal now, a threshold signature after the DKG | D41 / T37 |

## Since version 0.2

The text and the PDF describe commit `2ee5e79`. The repository has moved; where a
statement of the paper no longer holds, the specification wins. In order of the roadmap:

| Paper (v0.2) | Repository now | Where |
|---|---|---|
| §7.1 (D32): "none of the revisions is implemented yet"; the parameter table (Appendix A) lists `τ ≈ 0.08`, `ε ≈ 0.008` on the intercept scale | D32 is implemented (T49, 2026-09-24): `bridging::{two_means, side_balanced, bridge_scores}`, `gate::bridging_gate` with the provisional probability-scale constants `TAU = 0.80`, `EPS = 0.02`, `APPEAL_GAP = 0.25`; the fixtures, `sim/` and the golden outputs regenerated | `docs/01` D32, `docs/02` §A.3, `docs/10` T49 |
| §7.1: "eligibility for an appeal still reads `\|f_j\|`" | Amended: appeal eligibility reads the *side gap* `\|A_j − B_j\| ≥ 0.25`; `\|f_j\|` falls as the camps become unequal, the gap does not | `docs/01` D32 (banner), `docs/02` §A.3, `docs/08` BRIDGE-009 |
| §7.1: "a one-dimensional 2-means on `f_u`, initialized at `min f_u` and `max f_u`"; §7.1 leaves open that "2-means could split a wide majority camp" | Amended by D42 (T71, 2026-09-26), after the first pass of the characterization (`docs/13`): the iteration from the extremes stopped at a local optimum that made a few far-out reviewers a side of their own (2 and 5 of 800; 1 of 200 in a bootstrap subsample, dropping a robust score from 0.91 to 0.56). The sides are now the exact 2-means cut, each at least 5% of the reviewers; the predictions are clipped to [0, 1]; an item one side never rated goes to supplementary review (a partisan item had passed at 0.972 on an extrapolated side). The proposition *Invariance and camp balance* holds for the exact cut: (i) as stated, (ii) whenever each camp holds 5% of the reviewers | `docs/01` D42, `docs/02` §A.3, `docs/10` T71 |
| §7.1, Tables 10–11: the leak falls to between −0.08 and 0.00 | Measured on the engine: leak ≤ 0.1 from 200 reviewers; 0.1–0.2 residual with 50–100 reviewers (a handful of minority ratings per item); noisy side means with a minority side of about ten reviewers (at 95/5 one consensus item in eight fell to 0.78) | `docs/02` §A.3, `side_balanced.rs` (AT-BR-08/09) |
| §2 (setting): a band item "gets more reviewers and is re-decided against `τ`"; below the band a polarization rejection may appeal | Done as stated since T60 (2026-09-25): a band item gets `k_extra = 4` (provisional) more reviewers drawn outside its first panel, whose ratings join the first panel's before the re-decision against `τ`; a band item that fails it keeps the appeal when its side gap is at least the appeal threshold, and is `Rejected(Borderline)` otherwise (D26 amendment, T59) | `docs/01` D26, `docs/05` [5b], `docs/08` §9.1 |
| §5: the failed appeal "is to be recorded as a negative pseudo-observation inside `C_a` … The reference implementation still applies a simpler stake-and-refund rule" | Done as stated (D27, T61, 2026-09-25): `protocol::appeal::AuthorHistory` escrows a zero-quality observation at filing, the verdict replaces it with the item's quality on promotion and leaves it otherwise; the floor is the prior mean `α₀/(α₀+β₀)`; there is no additive gain; the stake-and-refund rule is removed | `docs/01` D27, `docs/02` §C.1, `docs/05` [5b], `docs/08` REPUTATION-007 |
| §7 (implementation): "reproducibility is tested bit for bit within a platform; cross-platform agreement has not yet been tested" | The transcendental functions come from the pure-Rust `libm` crate (`scoring::fmath`); the golden bits are checked on linux-gnu (dev and release), linux-musl, macOS-aarch64 and Windows-MSVC in CI (AT-BR-04, 2026-09-25) | `docs/02` §A.5, `docs/08` REPRO-001 |
| §7.3 (D37): the latent re-check "will run only when the anchors' KR-20 … is at least 0.90"; the differential gap kept as a diagnostic | Done (T53, 2026-09-25): `pilot::admit_anchors` and `revalidate_batch_latent` refuse a batch whose anchors' KR-20 on its respondents is below `KR20_MIN = 0.90`, computing θ from the anchors themselves; `MixtureDif::differential` reports the diagnostic. The target model is done (T54, 2026-09-25): `scoring::latent::latent_dif`, the anchors inside the likelihood and θ integrated on a grid, is the production fit; on the paper's null batches it selects one class at every anchor count (the proxy: two at 10, 20 and 30 anchors) and the campaigns of Table (2, 4, 6 of 8) are flagged on exactly the shifted items | `docs/01` D37, `docs/02` §B.3, `docs/08` DIF-010 |
| §7.2 (D33–D36): the leave-one-out difference score, odds weights with shrinkage, the CUSUM change detector, live outcomes with exploration, probation of 30 | D33, D34 and D36 done (T50, T51, 2026-09-25): `reputation::{loo_scores, mean_score, odds_weight, Cusum}`, `probation::SkillTrack`, `N_PROBATION = 30`, the cap binds on the odds scale. D35 done (T52, 2026-09-25): `protocol::exploration` — the beacon's draw of 5% of gate rejections piloted for measurement only (`Rejected → Explored → Measured`, never the pool), every observed score at weight `1/π_j` over every reviewed item (`SkillTrack::record_observed`/`record_unobserved`), the detector on the unweighted scores; the exploration proposition checked exactly and by Monte Carlo (AT-REP-06), the draw from the beacon (AT-PRO-07), the gate's false-negative rate recorded | `docs/01` D33, D36, `docs/02` §C.2, `docs/08` REPUTATION-005/008 |
| §7.4 (D38): contested facts "enter a separate pool, and a test draws them only in balanced sets"; open: "the DTF statistic across items fitted in different batches, and the classification procedure itself" | Done (T55, 2026-09-25). The two open points, specified: across batches the classes are not identified — the anchors are class-invariant and matching respondents would profile them — so a test's DTF is *bounded* by the sum of its per-fit unsigned DTFs, and the draw keeps that bound within `DTF_MAX = 0.10` score points (provisional); the classification is a source check anyone can redo from the citation committed at deposit, its last step a declared key rule on the cited data (no vote; a key resting on an interpretation is rejected as before). `scoring::dtf`, `protocol::contested`, `lifecycle::State::Contested`; AT-PRO-08 on hand-built and on fitted batches | `docs/01` D38, `docs/02` §B.5, §B.7, `docs/05` [7b], `docs/08` DIF-011 |
| §7.5 (D39–D41): residual correlation over long histories, panels instead of weights, the commit-reveal beacon | D39 done (T56, 2026-09-25): `collusion::{ResidualHistory, coordination_clusters}` reproduce Table 16 on the dataset ported to Rust (cartel +0.89 on residuals, honest +0.02; every cartel pair flagged, no honest pair) with `ρ_min = 0.7` (0.5 flags honest pairs by chance). D40 done (T57): `review::assign_diverse` seats at most one member of a cluster per panel, the extra round included, weights untouched — the uniform draw's 7.0% of panels with two or more members (Table 17) measured at 6.6% on the population ported to Rust, the diversified draw's 0%. D41 done (T37, 2026-09-26): the commit-reveal beacon among the consortium members (`network::beacon`, `docs/04` §The epoch's beacon), every draw seeded from it; the withholding figure (9/1000 to about 1.8%) is the residual the specification accepts | `docs/01` D39, `docs/02` §Anti-collusion, `docs/08` COLLUSION-002/003/005/006 |
| §2 (assumptions on the protocol layer) | The engine refuses malformed ratings instead of panicking (T62); a deposit is accepted once and its proof is bound to the epoch (T64); pilot respondents pass the identity gate and the floors count persons, not rows (T65) | `docs/08` §0-quinquies, `docs/10` Completed work |

The findings themselves (Sections 3–6) and the other revisions (D33–D41) are unchanged;
their tasks are `docs/10` T50–T57.
